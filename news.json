            "The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions against Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, effectively slamming the door on the country's top diplomat. ",
            "The sanctions freeze any of Zarif's assets in the United States or that are controlled by US entities, the government announced, saying it also will curtail his international travel. ",
            "\"Zarif implements the reckless agenda of Iran's Supreme Leader, and is the regime's primary spokesperson around the world. The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behavior is completely unacceptable,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.",
            "The designation of Zarif under the same sanctions earlier applied to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the latest blow by President Donald Trump to the Obama administration's attempt to end nuclear tensions through negotiations. ",
            "But in a mixed message to Tehran, Washington on Wednesday extended waivers for three Iranian civil nuclear projects, to avoid upsetting the other signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement \u2014 China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain. ",
            "\"This is a short 90 day extension,\" said White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, a champion of the hawkish policy towards Tehran. ",
            "\"We are watching those nuclear activities very, very closely, they remain under daily scrutiny,\" he told Fox Business. ",
            "Zarif has been at the heart of complex talks with foreign capitals over Iran's nuclear power industry, which Tehran says is peaceful, but Washington and regional allies including Israel insist is cover for a secret weapons programme.",
            "But a senior Trump administration official said that Zarif's diplomatic image \u2014 bolstered by his fluent English, self-effacing humour and background as a US-educated academic \u2014 was false. ",
            "\"The key issue is that he has had this veneer [...] of being the sincere and reasonable interlocutor for the regime. Our point today is that he is no such thing,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. ",
            "\"Today President Trump decided enough was enough,\" the official said, accusing Zarif of functioning as \"propaganda minister, not foreign minister\". ",
            "Zarif shot back, tweeting that Washington is trying to silence Iran on the international stage. ",
            " ",
            "\"The US' reason for designating me is that I am Iran's 'primary spokesperson around the world' Is the truth really that painful?\" he tweeted. ",
            "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the sanctions on Zarif showed that the US was 'afraid' of the top diplomat.",
            "In addition to attempting to freeze assets, Washington will also squeeze Zarif's ability to function as a globe-trotting diplomat. He is expected to be able to continue to visit the United Nations in New York, albeit under tight restrictions. ",
            "\"The United States will continue to uphold our obligations,\" the administration official said. ",
            "In mid-July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Zarif would be issued a visa but would be limited to the area reaching six blocks around the UN headquarters. ",
            "Trump last year left the 2015 denuclearisation accord negotiated by Zarif with six nations including the United States under former president Barack Obama and imposed crippling sanctions on Tehran's economy, also vowing to curb Tehran's regional influence. ",
            "With tensions escalating in June, Trump says he issued a last-minute cancellation of military strikes on Iran after it shot down a US drone. ",
            "Critics question the legal or diplomatic rationale for targeting Zarif, however, saying that sanctions will all but end the possibility of dialogue. ",
            " ",
            "\"If you sanction diplomats you'll have less diplomacy,\" Republican Senator Rand Paul tweeted. ",
            "The senior administration official insisted that Washington still wants talks \u2014 only not with Zarif. ",
            "US diplomats \"do not consider him to be our primary point of contact,\" the official said.",
            "\"If we do have an official contact with the Iranians, we want someone who is a significant decision maker.\"",
            "\"The United States continues to seek a diplomatic solution that addresses the Iranian regime's destructive behaviour. The only path forward is a comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of its threats,\" Pompeo said in a statement. ",
            "\"Until then, our campaign of diplomatic isolation and maximum economic pressure will continue,\" he said. ",
            "Zarif, meanwhile, sought to minimise the sanctions' impact on him, tweeting that they have \"no effect on me or my family, as I have no property or interests outside of Iran. Thank you for considering me such a huge threat to your agenda.\""

            "Since Imran Khan\u2019s recent visit to Washington, D.C. saw warm and pleasant vibes, it is worthwhile to ask about the substance of what was discussed during the visit. The first and foremost thing on the mind of the Trump administration is the desire to see a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, weeks before the visit, that they want to see an agreement with the Afghan Taliban that would enable such a withdrawal by September of this year.",
            "The agreement that the Trump administration seeks is a ceasefire, followed by some sort of power-sharing arrangement between the Taliban and the Afghan government. This is important to achieve in the immediate term, before the end of the year 2019, since Donald Trump wants to campaign on having delivered on this pledge to effect a withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. Campaign season begins in earnest in February of 2020 when the caucuses get under way, and builds up till July of that year when the Democratic party convention takes place and the party announces its candidate.",
            "Trump will want to show a tangible and visible withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan through these months, perhaps even heaping some ceremony onto the process, and claim success in the 18-year-old war as his signature accomplishment. Pakistan holds the key to whether or not he will be able to do this. Hence his sweet words during the visit.",
            "For Pakistan, the biggest fear is that there might be a repeat of 1990 all over again.",
            "The power-sharing arrangement will be a little trickier to manage, especially since powerful parties in Afghanistan, most notably India, would like to see such a deal scuttled. At the moment the Taliban have rejected any idea of including representatives from the government in Kabul into the peace talks. But an intra-Afghan dialogue has been kick-started, and one of the big asks that the Trump administration placed on the Pakistani delegation in D.C. was to play a more vigorous role in helping both sides in that dialogue to make progress in arriving at some sort of understanding among themselves.",
            "This is why we saw a flurry of headlines about an \u2018intra-Afghan dialogue\u2019 coming out in the Pakistani press in the run-up to the visit. \u201cIslamabad hopeful Taliban will agree to intra-Afghan dialogue\u201d ran a headline in this paper, for example. \u201cThe Afghan peace process has reached a promising but delicate stage. Pakistan will continue to play a role in helping the peace efforts with the expectation that this can soon transition to the next critical stage: an intra-Afghan dialogue. The international consensus is firmly in favour of this\u201d, the story quoted Pakistan\u2019s permanent representative to the United Nations, Dr Maleeha Lodhi.",
            "The dialogue did take place, supported by track two efforts. In mid-July, days before the D.C. visit, representatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government sat down with each other in Doha and agreed to reduce violence and to refrain from attacks on and around certain targets such as schools and hospitals, bazaars and places of worship, among others. The idea is now to build on this understanding, and pave the way towards a ceasefire followed by an agreement on power sharing.",
            "This is a steep ask for Pakistan to entertain, especially given the timelines. What makes the job trickier still is the role of the \u2018spoilers\u2019, but more than that, to ensure that the post withdrawal order is built to last. Moeed Yusuf of the United States Institute for Peace has had a chance to observe the entire process from a very close vantage point. He has written in this paper that Trump\u2019s ambition is not shared by the bureaucracy of the US federal government, particularly the diplomatic corps and the military, where suspicion of Pakistan runs deep. \u201cThe view within the system remains that Pakistan needs to be pressured to force greater cooperation on Afghanistan\u201d he wrote in these pages a few days ago.",
            "Some might argue that it is precisely such pressure that has persuaded Pakistan to do its part to help bring the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table in the first place. They might remind us of Trump\u2019s new year tweet, of the South Asia policy of August 2017 (that announcement was what set the ball rolling down the current path in the first place), as well as pressure mounted through international bodies like the Financial Action Task Force and the International Monetary Fund. If progress along the timeline laid down by the Trump administration continues apace, it is possible that pressure through both these bodies could fizzle out.",
            "The biggest challenge for the United States \u2014 whether the administration or the wider system driving the process \u2014 is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorist groups all over again following the withdrawal. For this reason, there is talk of a continuing counterterrorism presence after combat troops are withdrawn. Pakistan has already given its nod to such a continuing presence, and even hinted its willingness to host certain elements of such a force.",
            "For Pakistan, the biggest fear is that there might be a repeat of 1990 all over again. The fear is that once they are gone, the Americans will forget all about this region (their foreign policy already lays limited stakes in South Asia beyond Afghanistan), and Pakistan will once again be left to face the consequences all on its own. The other side of this fear is what happens if the Americans are not able to get all that they want out of the process currently under way. Trump\u2019s smile has saddled Pakistan with a steep ask, and nobody here wants to know what his frown might look like if things don\u2019t work out as expected.",
