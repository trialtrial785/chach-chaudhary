Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

            "In July 1999, the Indian Army was engaged in a ferocious battle against overwhelming odds in the icy heights of the Kargil Sector. It was the sheer bravery of Indian soldiers that led to our success against an entrenched enemy, and it is only fitting that the victory is being celebrated on its 20th anniversary, this year.",
            "It is, of course, another matter whether the lessons of the Kargil War, so faithfully recorded in the Kargil Review Committee (KRC), have been addressed. A number of articles have been written lamenting that many recommendations of the KRC and the subsequent Group of Ministers\u2019 report on National Security have either been ignored or only partially implemented. ",
            "Wars are never one-sided, and in our analysis of the Kargil operations, it is also essential to study the lessons that the Pakistan Army learned from this conflict. And I am deliberately referring to the Pakistan Army and not their government, because strategic decisions concerning India are firmly in the hands of Pakistani generals.",
            "The first lesson was that the Line of Control (LoC) had acquired the inviolability of an international border and that any attempt to change it by force, risked dragging Pakistan into a full-fledged war with India. The initial assumptions of the small clique of Kargil planners was that the Indian response to the intrusion would be limited and that it would force India to come to the negotiating table on the Kashmir issue. Both the assumptions were flawed, and there was massive criticism in Pakistan on the fallout of the Kargil misadventure. A Rand Corporation monograph report, titled Limited Conflicts Under the Nuclear Umbrella: Indian and Pakistani Lessons from the Kargil Crisis, quoted Shahid M. Amin, a long-serving Pakistani diplomat as articulating a \u201ccommonly held opinion\u201d when he stated, \u201cIt is high time that the country become ruthlessly realistic about its limitations and priorities. First and foremost, Pakistan\u2019s survival must precede everything else, including our attachment to the Kashmir cause.\u201d",
            "Also read | Air Force better equipped now than during Kargil conflict, says Dhanoa",
            "The second lesson was a result of the first. Kargil-type operations were no longer possible but a status quo on Kashmir, which suited India, was also not acceptable to the Pakistani deep state. Under these circumstances, the Pakistan Army would have to fall back on its trusted allies \u2014 the jihadis. The violence in Kashmir peaked following the Kargil war, and the number of terrorists killed doubled in the next two years, from 1387 in 1999 to 2645 in 2001. The Op Parakram mobilisation in 2002 [the mobilisation of troops launched in the wake of the December 13, 2011 attack on the Parliament] also saw little impact on infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan. In subsequent years, the Pakistan Army has calibrated the flow of terrorists into Kashmir, but only to suit its national interest. ",
            "The third lesson was on the utility of nuclear weapons. It was a commonly accepted view in Pakistan that the fear of an outbreak of nuclear war in South Asia would bring international pressure on India \u2014 led by the United States of America \u2014 and limit its response to terror activities sponsored by Pakistan. The Pakistan Army also saw its nuclear forces as deterring India from unleashing the full weight of its conventional superiority against Pakistan. The Indian decision to limit the conflict to the Kargil sector and not cross the LoC lent credence to this viewpoint. ",
            "However, there was also an understanding in the Pakistan Army that the presence of nuclear capability did not completely rule out a conventional conflict. As India adopted (though not officially) the Cold Start Doctrine (a strategy that relied on a speedy military victory while remaining below the nuclear threshold), Pakistan also set out to refine its conventional warfighting doctrine. The Pakistan Armed Forces conducted four Azm-e-Nau joint military exercises from 2009 to 2013, after which a doctrine named New Concept of War Fighting (NCWF) was formally adopted. The NCWF is designed to blunt India\u2019s conventional superiority by faster mobilisation and create additional reserves at all levels to absorb the initial Indian offensive. ",
            "Pakistan\u2019s weapons procurements in the last few years have also contributed to building up its conventional capability. Walter C. Ladwig, in his 2015 study, Indian Military Modernization and Conventional Deterrence in South Asia, has pointed out that \u201cIndia\u2019s defense procurement continues to underperform, producing far less in terms of military power than its spending would suggest. Conversely, Pakistan \u2014 assisted by China and others \u2014 has prevented the emergence of sharp asymmetries in the conventional military balance and even narrowed previously existing gaps.\u201d Today, Pakistan Army could feel reasonably confident in limiting India\u2019s success in a short, sharp conventional conflict.",
            "The final lesson was that the nature of civil-military relations in Pakistan leads to the making of poor strategic assessments. The Kargil war was entirely planned and commenced without taking the political leadership into confidence. Retired Lieutenant General of Pakistan army, Shahid Aziz, wrote in his article Putting our Children in Line of Fire, \u201cAn unsound military plan based on invalid assumptions, launched with little preparations and in total disregard to the regional and international environment, was bound to fail.\u201d",
            "Unfortunately, this lesson has not been learned, and the Pakistan military continues to wield enormous political influence. The political leadership of Pakistan has meekly accepted the dominant role of the army, and the judiciary has often overlooked extraconstitutional acts of the military by quoting the doctrine of necessity.

            "Once the Indian political establishment, led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, became aware of the extent of Pakistan\u2019s Kargil intrusion in 1999, it resolved to end it \u2014 if possible, without enlarging the conflict. Military and diplomatic elements of national power were brought into play in flawless coordination to achieve the objective. The splendid work of India\u2019s defence forces has attracted great attention, but not, in any substantial measure, the country\u2019s diplomatic endeavour in that testing time.",
            "The background to India\u2019s diplomacy during the Kargil ingress was provided by Vajpayee\u2019s visit to Lahore in February 1999. That visit was a consequence of a political initiative on the part of Vajpayee and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The two had first met in Colombo, on the sidelines of the Saarc summit, in July 1998, and had established a good rapport. Two months later, in their meeting on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York, they approved the modalities of the Composite Dialogue, and also decided to establish the Delhi-Lahore bus service. ",
            "After he had returned to power in February 1997, Sharif made efforts to tilt the country\u2019s civilian-military balance in the former\u2019s favour. He threw out the army chief, General Jahangir Karamat, in 1998, and hand-picked a relatively junior mohajir (a term to describe those who migrated from India during Partition)  general, Parvez Musharraf, to succeed him. At this time Sharif\u2019s father, the influential Mian Muhammad Sharif, made inroads among the army\u2019s corps commanders. These were indications that the Sharifs may be able to contain the army\u2019s role while India-Pakistan ties improved. Vajpayee\u2019s visit strengthened this impression, despite some negative army signals prior to his visit, and some during it. Apart from Vajpayee\u2019s statesmanlike gestures, the visit also resulted in the Lahore Declaration, the most substantial bilateral document after the Simla Agreement of 1972.",
            "As India proceeded with its response to the intrusion, there was no way of firmly knowing the extent of Sharif\u2019s involvement in the enterprise. It had to be logically assumed that he was fully complicit because of his seeming hold over the army. Besides, incontrovertible evidence had surfaced to show that Sharif had initially applauded the Kargil venture, though his father is believed to have admonished him for betraying Vajpayee. ",
            "At this stage, India had to rupture Sharif\u2019s relations with the army. It successfully did so with the recording of Musharraf\u2019s conversations with Chief of General Staff, General Aziz Khan, one of Indian external intelligence agency\u2019s great achievements, playing a crucial part. Pakistan claimed that the mujahideen, and not its regular troops, had crossed the Line of Control (LoC). It linked the intrusion to militant and terrorist actions in the Kashmir Valley. This lie was exposed. The Kargil tapes showed that Pakistani forces were the aggressors, but eventually the Pakistani claim was torn to shreds when Indian troops recovered army documents and personal effects of its soldiers from recaptured posts. The message was effectively conveyed to the international community that Pakistani regulars were directly involved.",
            "The Kargil ingress was a violation of the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir. Without conceding that its regular troops had crossed the LoC, Pakistan tried to obfuscate the issue by seeking to project that it had not taken any extraordinary step, and that both sides nibbled at the LoC from time to time. It also tried to sow further confusion, through counter allegations regarding the Indian presence in Siachen. Indian diplomats had to clarify the intricacies of the LoC to their international interlocutors. They effectively emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s action was direct and unacceptable territorial aggression. They also stressed that no responsible nuclear weapons-possessing State had ever undertaken such provocative and dangerous action against a neighbouring nuclear weapon State. ",
            "Pakistan had hoped that the major powers would insist on an immediate ceasefire, and that would leave it in control of the Kargil posts. Indian diplomacy had to ensure that instead of doing so, these important countries, especially the United States, leaned on Pakistan to withdraw from Kargil. The US in particular had to be convinced that India meant business. The military action, where Indian soldiers took a great number of casualties, but pursued the recovery of posts with an iron will, impressed the Americans of India\u2019s determination. This was backed by Vajpayee\u2019s simple-but-forceful confidential message to President Bill Clinton that the Pakistani action threatened India\u2019s northern defences, and would not be allowed to stand. ",
            "Months after India had militarily recovered some Kargil posts, through the heroism of its soldiers or where Pakistan retreated, a senior American diplomat told me that the US had told the Pakistanis early on that, in no case, would India allow Pakistan to get away with the Kargil intrusion. Clearly, diplomatic messaging coupled with military action made the required impact.",
            "Throughout the tense period from the discovery of Pakistan\u2019s Kargil surprise to India\u2019s success, Vajpayee remained ethereally calm and unwaveringly focused on the objective of throwing out Pakistan from Kargil. National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra ensured that all Indian institutions worked harmoniously to achieve the national aim of defeating Pakistan in Kargil. External affairs minister Jaswant Singh led the diplomatic effort from the front. Foreign secretary K Raghunath, ever thoughtful, sharpened India\u2019s diplomatic arguments to profile Pakistan\u2019s irresponsibility.",
            "Pakistan foreign minister Sartaj Aziz visited Delhi in June even as the fighting was raging. He suggested a ceasefire and an examination of the Indian charge of LoC violation to the Indian leadership. Maintaining complete diplomatic courtesy, Vajpayee and Singh told Aziz that India would compel Pakistan to vacate the Kargil posts whatever be the cost, and Pakistan should see the writing on the wall. Vajpayee asked Aziz, \u201cHow did the Lahore bus reach Kargil?\u201d",
            "Pakistan\u2019s Kargil intrusion made no strategic sense. It was premised on the Pakistani army\u2019s prejudice that India (read Hindus) doesn\u2019t have the stomach for sustained and difficult military actions. Now, Pakistani analysts uniformly blame a group of generals for Kargil. The problem is that the army has not abandoned its prejudices, and is engaged in the vain pursuit of confronting India, harming Pakistan and the region.",

He emerged from retirement to seek the presidency at age 88, presenting his centrist movement as a bulwark against rising Islamic fundamentalism and political chaos that rocked Tunisia after the people\u2019s people\u2019s revolt overthrew a longtime dictator and unleashed similar movements throughout the region.",

        "detailed_news": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\n    \n\nWASHINGTON: Prime Minister Imran Khan has assured members of the US Congress that Pakistan will continue to play its role to help achieve the shared objective of a political solution in Afghanistan.He said Pakistan was trying its level best to bring Taliban to the negotiating table and a significant achievement has been made in this regard. He, however, said it was not an easy task. He said the entire country including the army and security forces are on the same page for the common objective of peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict.At a reception hosted by the Congressional Pakistan Caucus on Tuesday, the prime minister maintained that peace in the region was vitally important for the promotion of Pakistan&rsquo;s development agenda. He said that Pakistan had extended its full support to facilitate direct talks between the US and Taliban, which had made progress. He said Pakistan was in defensive position in this war so how could the demand to &lsquo;do more&rsquo; have been made to it. He added that the past governments did not express ground realities to the US.Hours before concluding his historical trip to the United States, Imran Khan visited the Capitol Hill, and addressed a number of Congress members including Sen Gary Peters, Sen Sherrod Brown and Sen Chris Van Hollen and several members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was introduced to members of the Caucus including Republican Co-Chair Rep Jim Banks (R-IN) and Democratic Co-Chair Rep Thomas Suozzi (D-NY).The prime minister also met with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also joined the event.Speaking at the reception, Imran Khan thanked the attendees for the warm welcome and said that his government was committed to rebuilding the relationship on the basis of mutual trust and mutual respect.The prime minister said that Pakistan had facilitated the Afghan peace and reconciliation process as peace and stability in Afghanistan was vital for Pakistan. While cautioning about the complicated nature of the process and possible challenges, he said that Pakistan will continue to extend all possible facilitation in the process.Extending a warm welcome, Speaker Pelosi said it was a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister of Pakistan to the US Capitol and to discuss the vital ties between &ldquo;our economies, people & nations.&rdquo;  During the meeting, views were exchanged on matters relating to the Pakistan-US relations and regional developments.The prime minister told the Speaker that through his visit to the United States, he intended to enhance better understanding and renew and reinvigorate long-standing ties between the two countries. He said that Pakistan would continue to work with the United States for building an enduring partnership and promoting regional stability.The prime minister also shared his vision of peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia. He stressed that this could be achieved through peaceful resolution of outstanding disputes and building stable and cooperative relationships.The members of Congress also appreciated Pakistan&rsquo;s invaluable contribution in the Afghan peace and reconciliation process. They appreciated the role of the Pakistani American community in the US. They presented the prime minister copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the prime minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the US and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the US.Congresswoman Jackson Lee thanked the Prime Minister for visiting the Congress and expressed the hope that relations between the two countries could be deepened by enhancing exchanges between the parliamentary representatives of both sides. They were of the view that Prime Minister Khan&rsquo;s visit to the Capitol will help generate greater interest and foster better understanding of Pakistan in the US Congress.Agencies add: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said after his visit and interaction with the US leadership, the people of America will have a better understanding about Pakistan. Speaking to the US Congressmen at the Capitol Hill, he said Pakistan had always close ties with the United States and expressed the hope to get back to the relationship, which was based on truth and trust as well as mutual respect.Imran Khan expressed the hope that from now onward, relationship between the two countries would be at different level. He said unfortunately, he felt that Pakistan was not understood there, specifically in the last 15 years when the war on terror was being fought in Afghanistan and on the border of Pakistan.More than 70,000 Pakistani people died and our economy suffered billions of dollars loss in the war against terror. The prime minister said over 40 terrorist groups came to Pakistan because of the US war that it fought and its own existence was endangered by it. He said Pakistan was fighting the US war on terror while Pakistan had nothing to do with the 9/11. Al Qaida was in Afghanistan and there were no militant Taliban in Pakistan. He said it was very important that he met President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and explained to them the way forward that the relationship has to be based on mutual trust.Prime Minister Imran Khan said he would meet with the Taliban after returning to his country, as part of efforts to end the 18 years of war in Afghanistan.He said he had also spoken with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and now, when he goes back, \"I will meet the Taliban and I will try my best to get them to talk to the Afghan government.\"Speaking at the US Institute for Peace, a bipartisan federal body, Khan said he had been contacted by the Islamist extremist Afghan Taliban \"a few months back\", after his election win in July 2018, but did not take a meeting at that time because Kabul was not in favor of it. The militants reached out to him \"because I always maintained there was no military solution\" to the war in Afghanistan, he said.\"So because of that, I had a certain amount of credibility amongst them,\" added Khan. Khan earlier Tuesday met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who emphasised the importance of working together and \"Pakistan&rsquo;s significant role in supporting the Afghan peace process and counterterrorism,\" according to a US statement.\"It&rsquo;s not going to be easy because there&rsquo;s no centralised command, it&rsquo;s a devolved movement,\" Khan cautioned about the insurgent group. \"But we feel that if we all work together, we feel this is the best chance of there to be peace in Afghanistan.\"Khan also stressed that Afghanistan&rsquo;s presidential election in September \"must be an inclusive election where the Taliban also participate\". A breakthrough could pave the way for a withdrawal of international troops about 18 years after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, which led the US to launch an offensive that dislodged the Taliban government from Kabul. \"Today, there is no concept in Pakistan of &lsquo;strategic depth&rsquo; because we feel that by interfering in Afghanistan... we have actually done a lot of damage to our own country,\" he said.At the reception, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while addressing the ceremony, said the role of Congress is vital to further fortify the ties between Pakistan and the United States. The prime minister left for home Tuesday evening after the three-day visit to Washington.Congressmen presented Imran Khan a copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the prime minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the US and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the US.\n\t\t\t"

They were not harbouring him or hiding him or anything like that. We have very good insights on that. We probably differ with those who said that the Pakistanis were allowing him to live in that particular compound in Abbottabad,\" he said.David Petraeus said during counter-insurgency campaigns, Pakistani authorities could never close in on North Waziristan where terror outfits such as the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda and others had their headquarters.He said that the US learnt later on that OBL was not in that area but near the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad.\"I figured out later that I had probably flown right over his compound in a helicopter as I went to address the cadets at the military academy one time,\" he said, referring to the Pakistan Military Academy. David Petraeus said he hopes Imran Khan will be able to deal with the challenges of his country, where the economy is &ldquo;very distorted&rdquo; and where the \"realities of the situation are really quite difficult.\"\n\t\t\t"

        "detailed_news": "\n\n\t\t\t\tISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday strongly rebuffed that the contents of a reference against a judge of the Supreme Court were leaked from the Aiwan-e-Sadr as he had held thorough investigation into it.In an interview with a private TV channel he explained that he had received the reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa, judge of the Supreme Court, moved by the Ministry of Law and Justice.To a question in that regard the President further elaborated that after receiving the reference, he had three options over its disposal. First to sit over it like those who used such things for blackmailing (threats), second for holding a media trial, and the third one to proceed in accordance with relevant laws.He said that he preferred the legal one by sending the presidential reference to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) under the specific laws and expressed the confidence that SJC would decide it in accordance with the law.To another question, the President credited Prime Minister Imran Khan for effectively representing Pakistan&rsquo;s stance on various issues including a peaceful resolution to the Afghan issue during his visit to the United States. He said during the prime minister&rsquo;s visit, comprehensive talks were held on the peaceful resolution of the Afghan issue. Pakistan had assured the US about making all out efforts to bring Taliban to hold dialogue for the peaceful solution of the issue, he said adding, the US wanted a peaceful exit from Afghanistan and afterward, Pakistan could assist in the rehabilitation and restructuring efforts.The president to a question said the prime minister had already reminded the world and the US particularly that war was no solution to the issues as it was easy to flare up the conflicts without any end in the sight. President Trump thought out of the box which was his quality, he added.Parting ways with the transactional ties, the prime minister rightly projected that Pakistan wanted to live among the comity of nations with dignity and self respect which also correlated with PTI&rsquo;s motive of transforming the country into modern, Islamic and welfare state.President Alvi said that he had regular interaction with the opposition parties. In response to a question, he said media had a greater role than any other organ in the country to bring about social change by highlighting the social issues. The media should show the people the difference between the good and bad. It should further enhance its role and play its effective part in the national building, he added.The president informed that he had asked Pemra to provide him ranking of those TV channels concentrating on the social issues, so that they could be awarded.To another question, he said the process for the plea bargain as envisaged under the National Accountability law must be more open and should not be reached behind the closed doors. To make his point, the president cited a decision of the Supreme Court in which it opted for an offer over land encroachment case with Malik Riaz, the property tycoon.The president also advocated women&rsquo;s inheritance rights by saying that relevant laws were not being implemented. Recommendations in that regard had been forwarded to the Islamic Ideology Council, he said, adding religious elements, media and the prayers leaders should also play their respective roles in that regard.About International Court of Justice&rsquo;s decision on convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, the president said that the Attorney General for Pakistan and people in the Law Ministry had the opinion that consular access should have been provided to him. The ICJ held the same which was expected.The president said being an ordinary man, he wanted promotion of new technology in Pakistan and would like to work for provision of health facilities and ensuring women&rsquo;s hereditary rights, besides making efforts aimed at catering to the needs of the special people.He opined that MQM had changed itself and only the time would prove it how much the party had reformed itself. He stressed upon televising of special programmes at the PTV for those people who were suffering from hearing impairment.The president to a query said that he and his spouse had learnt many things from Imran Khan and his wife, including their passion for the welfare work.\n\t\t\t"

        "detailed_news": "\n\n\t\t\t\tTEHRAN: Iran&rsquo;s president has signalled a deal could be possible regarding the British-flagged tanker seized in the Strait of Hormuz.President Hassan Rouhani suggested on Wednesday that the Stena Impero vessel could be released if the UK takes similar steps to hand back an Iranian oil tanker seized by the Royal Navy off Gibraltar earlier this month.The remarks could help reduce tensions between the two countries as Boris Johnson takes over as Prime Minister. &ldquo;We do not seek the continuation of tension with some European countries,&rdquo; Rouhani said in comments carried on his website.&ldquo;Should they be committed to international frameworks and give up their wrong actions, including what they did in Gibraltar, they will receive a proportional response from Iran.&rdquo; Rouhani described the Iranian seizure of the UK-flagged Stena Impero as &ldquo;professional and brave&rdquo;.The comments came after the tanker&rsquo;s owners said the crew are safe following communications with them in Iran. The vessel was taken by Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guard on Friday amid worsening relations between Tehran and the West.Stena Bulk confirmed it has had direct contact with the crew of the impounded vessel.The ship&rsquo;s master said they were all safe and there had been good cooperation with the Iranian personnel on board. Stena Bulk said the crew&rsquo;s family members were being kept updated on the latest developments and being offered the firm&rsquo;s full support. Erik Hanell, president and CEO of Stena Bulk, said: &ldquo;We do of course appreciate this step of development and that this is a first sign that we will soon see more positive progress from the Iranian authorities.&rdquo;The development came as the head of the Iranian supreme leader&rsquo;s office said the UK was sending a mediator to negotiate for the release of the vessel.&ldquo;A country that at one time appointed ministers and lawyers in Iran has reached a point where they send a mediator and plead for their ship to be freed,&rdquo; Mohammad Mohammadi-Golpayegani said, according to the semi-official Tasnim news site.UK sources insisted they were not aware of any mediator being sent to Iran, insisting that diplomatic contacts were through the ambassador and embassy in Tehran. .\n\t\t\t"

He, however; said it was not an easy task. He said the entire country including army and security forces are on same page for a common objective of peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. At a reception hosted by the Congressional Pakistan Caucus on Tuesday, the prime minister maintained that peace in the region was vitally important for the promotion of Pakistan&rsquo;s development agenda.He said that Pakistan had extended its full support to facilitate direct talks between the US and Taliban, which had made progress. He said Pakistan was in defensive position in this war so how could the demand to &lsquo;do more&rsquo; have been made to it. He added that the past governments did not express ground realities to the US.Hours before concluding his historical trip to the United States, Imran Khan visited the Capitol Hill, and addressed a number of Congress members including Sen Gary Peters, Sen Sherrod Brown and Sen Chris Van Hollen and several members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was introduced to members of the Caucus including Republican Co-Chair Rep Jim Banks (R-IN) and Democratic Co-Chair Rep Thomas Suozzi (D-NY).The prime minister also met with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also joined the event.

While cautioning about the complicated nature of the process and possible challenges, he said that Pakistan will continue to extend all possible facilitation in the process.Extending a warm welcome, Speaker Pelosi said it was a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister of Pakistan to the US Capitol and to discuss the vital ties between &ldquo;our economies, people & nations.&rdquo;  During the meeting, views were exchanged on matters relating to Pakistan-US relations and regional developments.The Prime Minister told the Speaker that, through his visit to the United States, he intended to enhance better understanding and renew and reinvigorate long-standing ties between the two countries. He said that Pakistan would continue to work with the United States for building an enduring partnership and promoting regional stability.The Prime Minister also shared his vision of peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia. He stressed that this could be achieved through peaceful resolution of outstanding disputes and building stable and cooperative relationships.The members of Congress also appreciated Pakistan&rsquo;s invaluable contribution in the Afghan peace and reconciliation process. They appreciated the role of the Pakistani American community in the US. They presented the Prime Minister copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the Prime Minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the U.S. and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the U.S.Congresswoman Jackson Lee thanked the Prime Minister for visiting the Congress and expressed hope that relations between the two countries could be deepened by enhancing exchanges between the parliamentary representatives of both sides. They were of the view that Prime Minister Khan&rsquo;s visit to the Capitol will help generate greater interest and foster better understanding of Pakistan in the US Congress.Agencies add: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said after his visit and interaction with the US leadership, the people of America will have better understanding about Pakistan. Speaking to the US Congressmen at the Capitol Hill, he said Pakistan had always close ties with the United States and expressed the hope to get back to the relationship, which was based on truth and trust as well as mutual respect.Imran Khan expressed the hope that from now onward relationship between the two countries would be at different level. He said unfortunately, he felt that Pakistan was not understood there, specifically in the last 15 years when the war on terror was being fought in Afghanistan and on the border of Pakistan.More than 70,000 Pakistani people died and our economy suffered billions of dollars loss in the war against terror. The Prime Minister said over 40 terrorist groups came to Pakistan because of the US war that it fought and its own existence was endangered by it. he said Pakistan was fighting the US war on terror while Pakistan had nothing to do with the 9/11. Al Qaida was in Afghanistan and there were no militant Taliban in Pakistan. He said it was very important that he met President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and explained to them the way forward that the relationship has to be based on mutual trust.Prime Minister Imran Khan said he would meet with the Taliban after returning to his country, as part of efforts to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan.He said he had also spoken with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and now, when he goes back, \"I will meet the Taliban and I will try my best to get them to talk to the Afghan government.\"Speaking at the US Institute for Peace, a bipartisan federal body, Khan said he had been contacted by the Islamist extremist Afghan Taliban \"a few months back\", after his election win in July 2018, but did not take a meeting at that time because Kabul was not in favor of it.The militants reached out to him \"because I always maintained there was no military solution\" to the war in Afghanistan, he said.\"So because of that, I had a certain amount of credibility amongst them,\" added Khan. Khan earlier Tuesday met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who emphasised the importance of working together and \"Pakistan&acute;s significant role in supporting the Afghan peace process and counterterrorism,\" according to a US statement.\"It&acute;s not going to be easy because there&acute;s no centralised command, it&acute;s a devolved movement,\" Khan cautioned about the insurgent group. \"But we feel that if we all work together, we feel this is the best chance of there to be peace in Afghanistan.\"Khan also stressed that Afghanistan&acute;s presidential election in September \"must be an inclusive election where the Taliban also participate\". A breakthrough could pave the way for a withdrawal of international troops about 18 years after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, which led the US to launch an offensive that dislodged the Taliban government from Kabul.\"Today, there is no concept in Pakistan of &acute;strategic depth&acute; because we feel that by interfering in Afghanistan... we have actually done a lot of damage to our own country,\" he said.At the reception, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while addressing the ceremony, said the role of congress is vital to further fortify the ties between Pakistan and the United States.The Prime Minister left for home Tuesday evening after the three-day visit to Washington.Congressmen presented Imran Khan a copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the prime minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the US and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the US.\n\t\t\t"

        "detailed_news": "\n\n\t\t\t\tISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday strongly rebuffed that the contents of a reference against a judge of the Supreme Court were leaked from the Aiwan-e-Sadr as he had held thorough investigation into it.In an interview with a private TV channel he explained that he had received the reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa, judge of the Supreme Court, moved by the Ministry of Law and Justice.To a question in that regard the President further elaborated that after receiving the reference, he had three options over its disposal. First to sit over it like those who used such things for blackmailing (threats), second for holding a media trial, and the third one to proceed in accordance with relevant laws. He said that he preferred the legal one by sending the presidential reference to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) under the specific laws and expressed the confidence that SJC would decide it in accordance with the law. To another question, the President credited Prime Minister Imran Khan for effectively representing Pakistan&rsquo;s stance on various issues including a peaceful resolution to the Afghan issue during his visit to the United States. He said during the prime minister&rsquo;s visit, comprehensive talks were held on the peaceful resolution of the Afghan issue. Pakistan had assured the US about making all out efforts to bring Taliban to hold dialogue for the peaceful solution of the issue, he said adding, the US wanted a peaceful exit from Afghanistan and afterward, Pakistan could assist in the rehabilitation and restructuring efforts. The president to a question said the prime minister had already reminded the world and the US particularly that war was no solution to the issues as it was easy to flare up the conflicts without any end in the sight. President Trump thought out of the box which was his quality, he added.Parting ways with the transactional ties, the prime minister rightly projected that Pakistan wanted to live among the comity of nations with dignity and self respect which also correlated with PTI&rsquo;s motive of transforming the country into modern, Islamic and welfare state. President Alvi said that he had regular interaction with the opposition parties. In response to a question, he said media had a greater role than any other organ in the country to bring about social change by highlighting the social issues. The media should show the people the difference between the good and bad. It should further enhance its role and play its effective part in the national building, he added. The president informed that he had asked Pemra to provide him ranking of those TV channels concentrating on the social issues, so that they could be awarded.To another question, he said the process for the plea bargain as envisaged under the National Accountability law must be more open and should not be reached behind the closed doors. To make his point, the president cited a decision of the Supreme Court in which it opted for an offer over land encroachment case with Malik Riaz, the property tycoon. The president also advocated women&rsquo;s inheritance rights by saying that relevant laws were not being implemented. Recommendations in that regard had been forwarded to the Islamic Ideology Council, he said, adding religious elements, media and the prayers leaders should also play their respective roles in that regard. About International Court of Justice&rsquo;s decision on convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, the president said that the Attorney General for Pakistan and people in the Law Ministry had the opinion that consular access should have been provided to him. The ICJ held the same which was expected.The president said being an ordinary man, he wanted promotion of new technology in Pakistan and would like to work for provision of health facilities and ensuring women&rsquo;s hereditary rights, besides making efforts aimed at catering to the needs of the special people.He opined that MQM had changed itself and only the time would prove it how much the party had reformed itself. He stressed upon televising of special programmes at the PTV for those people who were suffering from hearing impairment.The president to a query said that he and his spouse had learnt many things from Imran Khan and his wife, including their passion for the welfare work.\n\t\t\t"

Imran Khan's statement on Osama bin Laden during an interview with Fox News on Monday was significant as Pakistan had so far denied that it had any information about the hideout of the al-Qaeda chief before he was killed in a covert raid by US Navy SEAL commandos in the garrison city of Abbottabad.According to media report, David Petraeus, during an interactive session at the Indian Consulate in New York City on Tuesday following his address on Indo-Pacific, asserted the US is convinced that the Pakistani intelligence was not aware that the terrorist leader was hiding in their country.\"We are quite convinced that the ISI, Pakistani intelligence, no one else knew that OBL was there in Pakistan. They were not harbouring him or hiding him or anything like that. We have very good insights on that. We probably differ with those who said that the Pakistanis were allowing him to live in that particular compound in Abbottabad,\" he said. David Petraeus said that during counter-insurgency campaigns, Pakistani authorities could never close in on North Waziristan where terror outfits such as the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda and others had their headquarters and some of their forces. He said that the US learnt later on that OBL was not in that area but near the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Abbottabad. \"I figured out later that I had probably flown right over his compound in a helicopter as I went to address the cadets at the military academy one time,\" he said, referring to the PMA. David Petraeus said he hopes Imran Khan will be able to deal with the challenges of his country, where the economy is &ldquo;very distorted&rdquo; and where the \"realities of the situation are really quite difficult.\"\n\t\t\t"

He said during the prime minister&rsquo;s visit, comprehensive talks were held on the peaceful resolution of the Afghan issue. Pakistan had assured the US about making all out efforts to  bring Taliban to hold dialogue for the peaceful solution of the issue, he said adding, the US wanted a peaceful exit from Afghanistan and afterward, Pakistan could assist in the rehabilitation and restructuring efforts.The president to a question said the prime minister had already reminded the world and the US particularly that war was no solution to the issues as it was easy to flare up the conflicts without any end in the sight. President Trump thought out of the box which was his quality, he added.Parting ways with the transactional ties, the prime minister rightly projected that Pakistan wanted to live among the comity of nations with dignity and self respect which also correlated with PTI&rsquo;s motive of transforming the country into modern, Islamic and welfare state. during his visit to the United States. In a series of tweets, she said the prime minister during his US visit, strongly highlighted the importance of resolution of outstanding dispute.She said Shahbaz Sharif should have also learnt from the simplicity and austerity of Imran Khan instead of criticising him for riding on the buses.Dr Awan claimed the popularity of the prime minister was increasing amongst the masses despite Shahbaz Sharif&rsquo;s efforts to misguide the people out of enviousness. &ldquo;Shahbaz Sahab! You do gimmickry by walking on London roads and when return to Pakistan, you fall back on the habit of protocol,&rdquo; she contended.Meanwhile, Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Wednesday said that provision of rights to the people, who were entitled to them, was mission of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\t\t\t"

        "detailed_news": "\n\n\t\t\t\tISLAMABAD: Former CIA Director General David Petraeus has said that he is \"convinced\" that the Pakistani intelligence agencies did not know Osama bin Laden (OBL) was in Pakistan, countering Prime Minister Imran Khan's claims that the ISI provided a lead to the CIA that helped the US track down and kill the terror group al-Qaeda&rsquo;s chief in 2011.Imran Khan's statement on Osama bin Laden during an interview with Fox News on Monday was significant as Pakistan had so far denied that it had any information about the hideout of the al-Qaeda chief before he was killed in a covert raid by US Navy SEAL commandos in the garrison city of Abbottabad.According to media report, David Petraeus, during an interactive session at the Indian Consulate in New York City on Tuesday following his address on Indo-Pacific, asserted the US is convinced that the Pakistani intelligence was not aware that the terrorist leader was hiding in their country.&ldquo;We are quite convinced that the ISI, Pakistani intelligence, no one else knew that OBL was there in Pakistan. They were not harbouring him or hiding him or anything like that. We have very good insights on that. We probably differ with those who said that the Pakistanis were allowing him to live in that particular compound in Abbottabad,&rdquo; he said. David Petraeus said that during counter-insurgency campaigns, Pakistani authorities could never close in on North Waziristan where terror outfits such as the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda and others had their headquarters and some of their forces.He said that the US learnt later on that OBL was not in that area but near the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Abbottabad. &ldquo;I figured out later that I had probably flown right over his compound in a helicopter as I went to address the cadets at the military academy one time,&rdquo; he said, referring to the PMA. David Petraeus said he hopes Imran Khan will be able to deal with the challenges of his country, where the economy is &ldquo;very distorted&rdquo; and where the &ldquo;realities of the situation are really quite difficult.&rdquo;\n\t\t\t"
