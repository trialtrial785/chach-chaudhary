Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

            "Since he took over, Gen Rawat has caused ripples within the 1.1 million strong force by first doing away with the sahayak (attendant) concept, disallowing golf in active forward areas of Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland, and finally put in place stringent measures to prevent his officers and men being honey-trapped through social media platforms.",

            "Intro: A freewheeling conversation with General VP Malik (retd), who was the army chief at the time of 1999 war",
            "In the history of India-Pakistan relations, 1999 stands out as the year when the much touted bus diplomacy at the Wagah border veered towards a war in Kargil in three months. The then Army chief General Ved Prakash Malik (79) \u2014 now retired, he is settled in Panchkula \u2014spoke to Ramesh Vinayak on what we\u2019ve learnt from the war, 20 years on. Edited excerpts: ",
            "As a limited conventional war, how did the Kargil conflict impact India\u2019s defense doctrine?",
            "At that time people thought that after the neighbours became nuclear nations, conventional war is not possible. In fact, that is what led to the Lahore Declaration in February 1999. But after the Kargil war, it became evident that there was space below the nuclear threshold. We may not go for an all-out war but a limited conventional war is possible. Now, both India and Pakistan are quite prepared to fight \u2014I hope they don\u2019t \u2014but that has come into our doctrine.",
            "Is India better prepared now than it was in 1999?",
            "Definitely. The geo-politics and geo-strategic dynamics keep changing. In 1990s, we shifted 8th Division from this area (Kargil) to Kashmir, which had flared up. Another brigade was moved to the Valley. That left a void. The first thing we did after the war was to plug those gaps. The 8 Mountain Division that had participated in the war is still deployed in that area. Post-1999, we brought in 14th Corps at Leh to look after the Line of Control (LoC) beyond Zoji La to Siachen, relieving the Srinagar-based 15th Corps, which has been engaged on the anti-insurgency grid. Third, and most importantly, our weapons and equipment, particularly the surveillance stuff, has improved. The road network and accommodation for troops in snow-bound areas has become better.",
            "There has been a lingering debate on a high toll of 527 men that the Indian Army suffered. ",
            "That was the result of two factors. One, the political objective given to the armed forces was to throw the Pakistani intruders out without crossing the LoC. We faced challenges such as a difficult terrain, lack of intelligence and poor surveillance. We suffered a high number of casualties between May 5, when the intrusions were first detected in Batalik, and May 21. Initially, the intruders holding the high features on our side of the LoC were thought to be \u2018mujahideens\u2019 (militants). So, the troops which were moved in and tasked to push them back followed the same tactics and rules of engagements that they generally do in anti-militancy operations in the Valley. It became evident to us on May 21 that they were Pakistani regulars. That is when I briefed the Cabinet Committee on Security that we were up not against militants but the enemy and said that all three of us (the Army, Air Force and Navy) needed to operate together. Then the whole thing changed. ",
            "How did New Delhi\u2019s behind-the-scene diplomatic push help?",
            "Kargil was a blend of military, political and diplomatic victory. At one stage, I told [the then] Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, \u2018Suppose we can\u2019t undo the intrusion here, then we will have to go across elsewhere. What will be your answer?\u2019 He understood that. Soon after, national security adviser Brajesh Mishra told television channels that \u2018not crossing the border holds good today, we don\u2019t know about tomorrow\u2019. In the meantime, our military strategy was unfolding on other fronts with the deployment of the infantry and strike formations on the rest of the western border. The navy had moved its fleet in the Arabian Sea. The air force had also taken action. When Mishra met his American counterpart, Sandy Berger, in Paris in the middle of June, he told him, \u201cLook, we can\u2019t keep our armed forces on a leash anymore.\u201d Berger took that message to then United States President Bill Clinton. Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif first visited China but failed to get any support. He was in panic when he travelled to the US and met Clinton on July 4. That very day, our army captured Tiger Hill. The writing was on the wall.",
            "The Kargil Review Committee, led by K Subrahmanyam, had made a slew of recommendations. How has the implementation been?",
            "Many of them have been implemented but not in the spirit in which they were recommended. Certain important recommendations remain unimplemented. For example, the chief of defence staff (CDS) has not happened even after it was accepted by the cabinet years ago. This is affecting our military strategy doctrine. The services are fighting their own turf wars. They didn\u2019t integrate the ministry of defence. The atmosphere in the ministry continues to be civil versus military. That\u2019s why there are problems when it comes to the management of the army and the budget.",
            "What is your searing memory of Kargil?",
            "It is a mix of happy and sad memories. The most important thing for me was going to the front. In South Block, whether I was meeting politicians or bureaucrats or my colleagues, I found long faces. There were questions and \u2018hoga ki nahin hoga (will it, won\u2019t it) \u2019 kind of mood. The morale was brittle initially. But every time I went to the war zone, almost every sixth day, I never saw that kind of mood. Despite casualties, the morale was high. My officers would tell me, \u201cDon\u2019t worry sir, we will do it.\u201d The positive attitude, the bravery and sacrifices I saw there raised my morale. I came back more confident that we will beat Pakistan. The other memory is about meeting young soldiers, many of whom are no more. I remember patting Capt Vikram Batra and giving him a bottle of scotch after he captured Point 5140. A few days later, he made the supreme sacrifice that earned him the Param Vir Chakra.",

            "In July 1999, the Indian Army was engaged in a ferocious battle against overwhelming odds in the icy heights of the Kargil Sector. It was the sheer bravery of Indian soldiers that led to our success against an entrenched enemy, and it is only fitting that the victory is being celebrated on its 20th anniversary, this year.",
            "It is, of course, another matter whether the lessons of the Kargil War, so faithfully recorded in the Kargil Review Committee (KRC), have been addressed. A number of articles have been written lamenting that many recommendations of the KRC and the subsequent Group of Ministers\u2019 report on National Security have either been ignored or only partially implemented. ",
            "Wars are never one-sided, and in our analysis of the Kargil operations, it is also essential to study the lessons that the Pakistan Army learned from this conflict. And I am deliberately referring to the Pakistan Army and not their government, because strategic decisions concerning India are firmly in the hands of Pakistani generals.",
            "The first lesson was that the Line of Control (LoC) had acquired the inviolability of an international border and that any attempt to change it by force, risked dragging Pakistan into a full-fledged war with India. The initial assumptions of the small clique of Kargil planners was that the Indian response to the intrusion would be limited and that it would force India to come to the negotiating table on the Kashmir issue. Both the assumptions were flawed, and there was massive criticism in Pakistan on the fallout of the Kargil misadventure. A Rand Corporation monograph report, titled Limited Conflicts Under the Nuclear Umbrella: Indian and Pakistani Lessons from the Kargil Crisis, quoted Shahid M. Amin, a long-serving Pakistani diplomat as articulating a \u201ccommonly held opinion\u201d when he stated, \u201cIt is high time that the country become ruthlessly realistic about its limitations and priorities. First and foremost, Pakistan\u2019s survival must precede everything else, including our attachment to the Kashmir cause.\u201d",
            "Also read | Air Force better equipped now than during Kargil conflict, says Dhanoa",
            "The second lesson was a result of the first. Kargil-type operations were no longer possible but a status quo on Kashmir, which suited India, was also not acceptable to the Pakistani deep state. Under these circumstances, the Pakistan Army would have to fall back on its trusted allies \u2014 the jihadis. The violence in Kashmir peaked following the Kargil war, and the number of terrorists killed doubled in the next two years, from 1387 in 1999 to 2645 in 2001. The Op Parakram mobilisation in 2002 [the mobilisation of troops launched in the wake of the December 13, 2011 attack on the Parliament] also saw little impact on infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan. In subsequent years, the Pakistan Army has calibrated the flow of terrorists into Kashmir, but only to suit its national interest. ",
            "The third lesson was on the utility of nuclear weapons. It was a commonly accepted view in Pakistan that the fear of an outbreak of nuclear war in South Asia would bring international pressure on India \u2014 led by the United States of America \u2014 and limit its response to terror activities sponsored by Pakistan. The Pakistan Army also saw its nuclear forces as deterring India from unleashing the full weight of its conventional superiority against Pakistan. The Indian decision to limit the conflict to the Kargil sector and not cross the LoC lent credence to this viewpoint. ",
            "However, there was also an understanding in the Pakistan Army that the presence of nuclear capability did not completely rule out a conventional conflict. As India adopted (though not officially) the Cold Start Doctrine (a strategy that relied on a speedy military victory while remaining below the nuclear threshold), Pakistan also set out to refine its conventional warfighting doctrine. The Pakistan Armed Forces conducted four Azm-e-Nau joint military exercises from 2009 to 2013, after which a doctrine named New Concept of War Fighting (NCWF) was formally adopted. The NCWF is designed to blunt India\u2019s conventional superiority by faster mobilisation and create additional reserves at all levels to absorb the initial Indian offensive. ",
            "Pakistan\u2019s weapons procurements in the last few years have also contributed to building up its conventional capability. Walter C. Ladwig, in his 2015 study, Indian Military Modernization and Conventional Deterrence in South Asia, has pointed out that \u201cIndia\u2019s defense procurement continues to underperform, producing far less in terms of military power than its spending would suggest. Conversely, Pakistan \u2014 assisted by China and others \u2014 has prevented the emergence of sharp asymmetries in the conventional military balance and even narrowed previously existing gaps.\u201d Today, Pakistan Army could feel reasonably confident in limiting India\u2019s success in a short, sharp conventional conflict.",
            "The final lesson was that the nature of civil-military relations in Pakistan leads to the making of poor strategic assessments. The Kargil war was entirely planned and commenced without taking the political leadership into confidence. Retired Lieutenant General of Pakistan army, Shahid Aziz, wrote in his article Putting our Children in Line of Fire, \u201cAn unsound military plan based on invalid assumptions, launched with little preparations and in total disregard to the regional and international environment, was bound to fail.\u201d",
            "Unfortunately, this lesson has not been learned, and the Pakistan military continues to wield enormous political influence. The political leadership of Pakistan has meekly accepted the dominant role of the army, and the judiciary has often overlooked extraconstitutional acts of the military by quoting the doctrine of necessity. This will result in a continuation of Pakistan Army\u2019s risk-taking behaviour without fully comprehending the political and diplomatic fallout of their actions.",
            "In studying any war, perspectives of the vanquished also matter. As Sun Tzu said, \u201cIf you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\u201d Let us celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Kargil war, but also be pragmatic in recognising the limited impact it had in changing Pakistan Army\u2019s fundamental attitudes towards India.

            "Once the Indian political establishment, led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, became aware of the extent of Pakistan\u2019s Kargil intrusion in 1999, it resolved to end it \u2014 if possible, without enlarging the conflict. Military and diplomatic elements of national power were brought into play in flawless coordination to achieve the objective. The splendid work of India\u2019s defence forces has attracted great attention, but not, in any substantial measure, the country\u2019s diplomatic endeavour in that testing time.",
            "The background to India\u2019s diplomacy during the Kargil ingress was provided by Vajpayee\u2019s visit to Lahore in February 1999. That visit was a consequence of a political initiative on the part of Vajpayee and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The two had first met in Colombo, on the sidelines of the Saarc summit, in July 1998, and had established a good rapport. Two months later, in their meeting on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York, they approved the modalities of the Composite Dialogue, and also decided to establish the Delhi-Lahore bus service. ",
            "After he had returned to power in February 1997, Sharif made efforts to tilt the country\u2019s civilian-military balance in the former\u2019s favour. He threw out the army chief, General Jahangir Karamat, in 1998, and hand-picked a relatively junior mohajir (a term to describe those who migrated from India during Partition)  general, Parvez Musharraf, to succeed him. At this time Sharif\u2019s father, the influential Mian Muhammad Sharif, made inroads among the army\u2019s corps commanders. These were indications that the Sharifs may be able to contain the army\u2019s role while India-Pakistan ties improved. Vajpayee\u2019s visit strengthened this impression, despite some negative army signals prior to his visit, and some during it. Apart from Vajpayee\u2019s statesmanlike gestures, the visit also resulted in the Lahore Declaration, the most substantial bilateral document after the Simla Agreement of 1972.",
            "As India proceeded with its response to the intrusion, there was no way of firmly knowing the extent of Sharif\u2019s involvement in the enterprise. It had to be logically assumed that he was fully complicit because of his seeming hold over the army. Besides, incontrovertible evidence had surfaced to show that Sharif had initially applauded the Kargil venture, though his father is believed to have admonished him for betraying Vajpayee. ",
            "At this stage, India had to rupture Sharif\u2019s relations with the army. It successfully did so with the recording of Musharraf\u2019s conversations with Chief of General Staff, General Aziz Khan, one of Indian external intelligence agency\u2019s great achievements, playing a crucial part. Pakistan claimed that the mujahideen, and not its regular troops, had crossed the Line of Control (LoC). It linked the intrusion to militant and terrorist actions in the Kashmir Valley. This lie was exposed. The Kargil tapes showed that Pakistani forces were the aggressors, but eventually the Pakistani claim was torn to shreds when Indian troops recovered army documents and personal effects of its soldiers from recaptured posts. The message was effectively conveyed to the international community that Pakistani regulars were directly involved.",
            "The Kargil ingress was a violation of the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir. Without conceding that its regular troops had crossed the LoC, Pakistan tried to obfuscate the issue by seeking to project that it had not taken any extraordinary step, and that both sides nibbled at the LoC from time to time. It also tried to sow further confusion, through counter allegations regarding the Indian presence in Siachen. Indian diplomats had to clarify the intricacies of the LoC to their international interlocutors. They effectively emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s action was direct and unacceptable territorial aggression. They also stressed that no responsible nuclear weapons-possessing State had ever undertaken such provocative and dangerous action against a neighbouring nuclear weapon State. ",
            "Pakistan had hoped that the major powers would insist on an immediate ceasefire, and that would leave it in control of the Kargil posts. Indian diplomacy had to ensure that instead of doing so, these important countries, especially the United States, leaned on Pakistan to withdraw from Kargil. The US in particular had to be convinced that India meant business. The military action, where Indian soldiers took a great number of casualties, but pursued the recovery of posts with an iron will, impressed the Americans of India\u2019s determination. This was backed by Vajpayee\u2019s simple-but-forceful confidential message to President Bill Clinton that the Pakistani action threatened India\u2019s northern defences, and would not be allowed to stand. ",
            "Months after India had militarily recovered some Kargil posts, through the heroism of its soldiers or where Pakistan retreated, a senior American diplomat told me that the US had told the Pakistanis early on that, in no case, would India allow Pakistan to get away with the Kargil intrusion. Clearly, diplomatic messaging coupled with military action made the required impact.",
            "Throughout the tense period from the discovery of Pakistan\u2019s Kargil surprise to India\u2019s success, Vajpayee remained ethereally calm and unwaveringly focused on the objective of throwing out Pakistan from Kargil. National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra ensured that all Indian institutions worked harmoniously to achieve the national aim of defeating Pakistan in Kargil. External affairs minister Jaswant Singh led the diplomatic effort from the front. Foreign secretary K Raghunath, ever thoughtful, sharpened India\u2019s diplomatic arguments to profile Pakistan\u2019s irresponsibility.",
            "Pakistan foreign minister Sartaj Aziz visited Delhi in June even as the fighting was raging. He suggested a ceasefire and an examination of the Indian charge of LoC violation to the Indian leadership. Maintaining complete diplomatic courtesy, Vajpayee and Singh told Aziz that India would compel Pakistan to vacate the Kargil posts whatever be the cost, and Pakistan should see the writing on the wall. Vajpayee asked Aziz, \u201cHow did the Lahore bus reach Kargil?\u201d",
            "Pakistan\u2019s Kargil intrusion made no strategic sense. It was premised on the Pakistani army\u2019s prejudice that India (read Hindus) doesn\u2019t have the stomach for sustained and difficult military actions. Now, Pakistani analysts uniformly blame a group of generals for Kargil. The problem is that the army has not abandoned its prejudices, and is engaged in the vain pursuit of confronting India, harming Pakistan and the region.",

            "The Afghan Taliban have said that they will visit Pakistan and meet Prime Minister Imran Khan if they are formally invited for a meeting by Islamabad, BBC Urdu reported on Thursday, citing an official.",
            "During his visit to the United States earlier this week, Prime Minister Imran had hinted at a possible meeting with the insurgents.",
            "He had said he hoped that in the coming days, \"we will be able to urge the Taliban to talk with the Afghan government and come to a political solution\", a point that was promptly appreciated by US President Donald Trump \u2014 who noted that Pakistan had helped in the Afghan peace talks tremendously in recent weeks.",
            "Suhail Shaheen, the spokesman for the Taliban's political office in Qatar, told the BBC via telephone that members of the group would go to Pakistan if invited by the government.",
            "\"We visit regional and neighbouring countries from time to time, so if Pakistan formally invites us we will go because Pakistan too is our neighbour and a Muslim country,\" he was quoted as saying in the report.",
            "Shaheen dismissed the idea that a meeting with Pakistani authorities would entail allegations that the militant group has Pakistan's support, saying such allegations will be levelled by \"only the people who have no other justification to fight the Taliban\".",
            "He said although they don't allow anyone to interfere in their Islamic and national interests, \"as concerned the process of establishing contact with other countries or neighbouring countries, we already have contacts with them and we want to have [the same]\".",
            "According to the BBC report, a delegation of the Afghan Taliban was set to visit Islamabad and meet the prime minister earlier in February as well, but Imran Khan had refused to meet them after the Afghan government expressed concern over the gathering. The meeting that is expected to take place in the coming days will be with the consent of the Afghan government, the report said.",
            "After completing his maiden visit to Washington earlier this week, Prime Minister Imran had taken to Twitter to assure Trump that Pakistan \"will do everything within its power\" to facilitate the process aimed at ending Afghanistan's nearly 18-year war. The world owed it to the people of Afghanistan to bring about peace after four decades of conflict, the premier had added.",
            "The Taliban spokesperson also suggested that the group would meet all Afghan parties, including the Afghan government, if the ongoing talks with foreign powers turn out to be successful. ",
            "\"We have divided the Afghan issue into two stages, one external and the other internal. The negotiations underway in the first stage have reached the concluding stage.",
            "\"If these talks turn out to be successful, then in the second stage we will hold talks with all Afghan parties, in which the Afghan government too can participate as a party,\" he told the BBC. "

            "Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi, the North African country\u2019s first democratically elected leader and heir to Tunisia\u2019s founding father, has died. He was 92.",
            "Essebsi died Thursday morning at the Tunis military hospital, where he was taken the night before, an official in the president\u2019s office told The Associated Press. The presidential Facebook page said funeral plans will be announced soon.",
            "Under Tunisia\u2019s constitution, the president of the parliament will assume the presidency for 45 to 90 days while elections are organised.",
            "Essebsi won office in 2014 in the wake of the country\u2019s Arab Spring uprising. He emerged from retirement to seek the presidency at age 88, presenting his centrist movement as a bulwark against rising Islamic fundamentalism and political chaos that rocked Tunisia after the people\u2019s people\u2019s revolt overthrew a longtime dictator and unleashed similar movements throughout the region.",
            "But Essebsi was ultimately unable to bring prosperity or lasting calm to a country shaken by economic crises compounded by sporadic terror attacks.",
            "Most of Essebsi\u2019s political career came well before the Arab Spring. He was a symbol of Tunisia\u2019s independence generation, though he outlived most of his peers who helped the country shake off French rule in 1956.",
            "Born November 29, 1926 when Tunisia was a French protectorate, Essebsi entered politics in the 1940s and trained as a lawyer in Paris. But his name is most associated with Tunisia\u2019s first president, Habib Bourguiba, who built up the country and educated its people \u2014 and brooked little opposition.",
            "Essebsi proudly claimed to be Bourguiba\u2019s disciple, and from 1965 to 1986, he held several senior roles including defense minister, foreign minister and interior minister.",
            "After Bourguiba was overthrown in a bloodless coup by Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in 1987, Essebsi took up a quiet life as a lawyer and author, until his re-emergence after the Arab Spring.",
            "Tunisia remains a haven of political openness and relative peace compared to the strongmen elsewhere in the Arab world and the chaos reigning in Libya.",
            "But the country has gone through nine governments since the 2011 uprising, and each one has failed to resolve widespread poverty, unemployment and disillusionment with democracy. Attacks by Islamic extremists, including some trained in neighboring Libya, have killed dozens and sent foreign tourists fleeing.",
            "Threatened this year with a general strike, Essebsi acknowledged the problems he was unable to resolve.",
            "\u201cA democracy cannot be built in eight years,\u201d he said in January. \u201cTangible results need time.\u201d",
            "Essebsi recently announced he wouldn\u2019t run in the election scheduled for November, saying a younger person should lead the country.",
            "Concerns had been growing about his fitness for office after he was hospitalised three times in recent weeks. His office released a video of the president meeting with the defense minister Monday, and Essebsi was visibly weakened."
