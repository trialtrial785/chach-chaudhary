Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

",
            "The Kargil war lasted a little over two months and led to 527 deaths on India\u2019s side. ",

            "\u201cKargil was the outcome of intelligence failures.

            "In July 1999, the Indian Army was engaged in a ferocious battle against overwhelming odds in the icy heights of the Kargil Sector. It was the sheer bravery of Indian soldiers that led to our success against an entrenched enemy, and it is only fitting that the victory is being celebrated on its 20th anniversary, this year.",
            "It is, of course, another matter whether the lessons of the Kargil War, so faithfully recorded in the Kargil Review Committee (KRC), have been addressed. A number of articles have been written lamenting that many recommendations of the KRC and the subsequent Group of Ministers\u2019 report on National Security have either been ignored or only partially implemented. ",
            "Wars are never one-sided, and in our analysis of the Kargil operations, it is also essential to study the lessons that the Pakistan Army learned from this conflict. And I am deliberately referring to the Pakistan Army and not their government, because strategic decisions concerning India are firmly in the hands of Pakistani generals.",
            "The first lesson was that the Line of Control (LoC) had acquired the inviolability of an international border and that any attempt to change it by force, risked dragging Pakistan into a full-fledged war with India. The initial assumptions of the small clique of Kargil planners was that the Indian response to the intrusion would be limited and that it would force India to come to the negotiating table on the Kashmir issue. Both the assumptions were flawed, and there was massive criticism in Pakistan on the fallout of the Kargil misadventure. A Rand Corporation monograph report, titled Limited Conflicts Under the Nuclear Umbrella: Indian and Pakistani Lessons from the Kargil Crisis, quoted Shahid M. Amin, a long-serving Pakistani diplomat as articulating a \u201ccommonly held opinion\u201d when he stated, \u201cIt is high time that the country become ruthlessly realistic about its limitations and priorities. First and foremost, Pakistan\u2019s survival must precede everything else, including our attachment to the Kashmir cause.\u201d",
            "Also read | Air Force better equipped now than during Kargil conflict, says Dhanoa",
            "The second lesson was a result of the first. Kargil-type operations were no longer possible but a status quo on Kashmir, which suited India, was also not acceptable to the Pakistani deep state. Under these circumstances, the Pakistan Army would have to fall back on its trusted allies \u2014 the jihadis. The violence in Kashmir peaked following the Kargil war, and the number of terrorists killed doubled in the next two years, from 1387 in 1999 to 2645 in 2001. The Op Parakram mobilisation in 2002 [the mobilisation of troops launched in the wake of the December 13, 2011 attack on the Parliament] also saw little impact on infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan. In subsequent years, the Pakistan Army has calibrated the flow of terrorists into Kashmir, but only to suit its national interest. ",
            "The third lesson was on the utility of nuclear weapons. It was a commonly accepted view in Pakistan that the fear of an outbreak of nuclear war in South Asia would bring international pressure on India \u2014 led by the United States of America \u2014 and limit its response to terror activities sponsored by Pakistan. The Pakistan Army also saw its nuclear forces as deterring India from unleashing the full weight of its conventional superiority against Pakistan. The Indian decision to limit the conflict to the Kargil sector and not cross the LoC lent credence to this viewpoint. ",
            "However, there was also an understanding in the Pakistan Army that the presence of nuclear capability did not completely rule out a conventional conflict. As India adopted (though not officially) the Cold Start Doctrine (a strategy that relied on a speedy military victory while remaining below the nuclear threshold), Pakistan also set out to refine its conventional warfighting doctrine. The Pakistan Armed Forces conducted four Azm-e-Nau joint military exercises from 2009 to 2013, after which a doctrine named New Concept of War Fighting (NCWF) was formally adopted. The NCWF is designed to blunt India\u2019s conventional superiority by faster mobilisation and create additional reserves at all levels to absorb the initial Indian offensive. ",
            "Pakistan\u2019s weapons procurements in the last few years have also contributed to building up its conventional capability. Walter C. Ladwig, in his 2015 study, Indian Military Modernization and Conventional Deterrence in South Asia, has pointed out that \u201cIndia\u2019s defense procurement continues to underperform, producing far less in terms of military power than its spending would suggest. Conversely, Pakistan \u2014 assisted by China and others \u2014 has prevented the emergence of sharp asymmetries in the conventional military balance and even narrowed previously existing gaps.\u201d Today, Pakistan Army could feel reasonably confident in limiting India\u2019s success in a short, sharp conventional conflict.",
            "The final lesson was that the nature of civil-military relations in Pakistan leads to the making of poor strategic assessments. The Kargil war was entirely planned and commenced without taking the political leadership into confidence. Retired Lieutenant General of Pakistan army, Shahid Aziz, wrote in his article Putting our Children in Line of Fire, \u201cAn unsound military plan based on invalid assumptions, launched with little preparations and in total disregard to the regional and international environment, was bound to fail.\u201d",
            "Unfortunately, this lesson has not been learned, and the Pakistan military continues to wield enormous political influence. The political leadership of Pakistan has meekly accepted the dominant role of the army, and the judiciary has often overlooked extraconstitutional acts of the military by quoting the doctrine of necessity. This will result in a continuation of Pakistan Army\u2019s risk-taking behaviour without fully comprehending the political and diplomatic fallout of their actions.",
            "In studying any war, perspectives of the vanquished also matter. As Sun Tzu said, \u201cIf you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\u201d Let us celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Kargil war, but also be pragmatic in recognising the limited impact it had in changing Pakistan Army\u2019s fundamental attitudes towards India.

Military and diplomatic elements of national power were brought into play in flawless coordination to achieve the objective.

            "The background to India\u2019s diplomacy during the Kargil ingress was provided by Vajpayee\u2019s visit to Lahore in February 1999. That visit was a consequence of a political initiative on the part of Vajpayee and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The two had first met in Colombo, on the sidelines of the Saarc summit, in July 1998, and had established a good rapport. Two months later, in their meeting on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York, they approved the modalities of the Composite Dialogue, and also decided to establish the Delhi-Lahore bus service.

He threw out the army chief, General Jahangir Karamat, in 1998, and hand-picked a relatively junior mohajir (a term to describe those who migrated from India during Partition)  general, Parvez Musharraf, to succeed him. At this time Sharif\u2019s father, the influential Mian Muhammad Sharif, made inroads among the army\u2019s corps commanders. These were indications that the Sharifs may be able to contain the army\u2019s role while India-Pakistan ties improved. Vajpayee\u2019s visit strengthened this impression, despite some negative army signals prior to his visit, and some during it. Apart from Vajpayee\u2019s statesmanlike gestures, the visit also resulted in the Lahore Declaration, the most substantial bilateral document after the Simla Agreement of 1972.",
            "As India proceeded with its response to the intrusion, there was no way of firmly knowing the extent of Sharif\u2019s involvement in the enterprise. It had to be logically assumed that he was fully complicit because of his seeming hold over the army. Besides, incontrovertible evidence had surfaced to show that Sharif had initially applauded the Kargil venture, though his father is believed to have admonished him for betraying Vajpayee. ",
            "At this stage, India had to rupture Sharif\u2019s relations with the army. It successfully did so with the recording of Musharraf\u2019s conversations with Chief of General Staff, General Aziz Khan, one of Indian external intelligence agency\u2019s great achievements, playing a crucial part. Pakistan claimed that the mujahideen, and not its regular troops, had crossed the Line of Control (LoC). It linked the intrusion to militant and terrorist actions in the Kashmir Valley. This lie was exposed. The Kargil tapes showed that Pakistani forces were the aggressors, but eventually the Pakistani claim was torn to shreds when Indian troops recovered army documents and personal effects of its soldiers from recaptured posts. The message was effectively conveyed to the international community that Pakistani regulars were directly involved.",
            "The Kargil ingress was a violation of the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir. Without conceding that its regular troops had crossed the LoC, Pakistan tried to obfuscate the issue by seeking to project that it had not taken any extraordinary step, and that both sides nibbled at the LoC from time to time. It also tried to sow further confusion, through counter allegations regarding the Indian presence in Siachen. Indian diplomats had to clarify the intricacies of the LoC to their international interlocutors. They effectively emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s action was direct and unacceptable territorial aggression. They also stressed that no responsible nuclear weapons-possessing State had ever undertaken such provocative and dangerous action against a neighbouring nuclear weapon State. ",
            "Pakistan had hoped that the major powers would insist on an immediate ceasefire, and that would leave it in control of the Kargil posts. Indian diplomacy had to ensure that instead of doing so, these important countries, especially the United States, leaned on Pakistan to withdraw from Kargil. The US in particular had to be convinced that India meant business. The military action, where Indian soldiers took a great number of casualties, but pursued the recovery of posts with an iron will, impressed the Americans of India\u2019s determination. This was backed by Vajpayee\u2019s simple-but-forceful confidential message to President Bill Clinton that the Pakistani action threatened India\u2019s northern defences, and would not be allowed to stand. ",
            "Months after India had militarily recovered some Kargil posts, through the heroism of its soldiers or where Pakistan retreated, a senior American diplomat told me that the US had told the Pakistanis early on that, in no case, would India allow Pakistan to get away with the Kargil intrusion. Clearly, diplomatic messaging coupled with military action made the required impact.",
            "Throughout the tense period from the discovery of Pakistan\u2019s Kargil surprise to India\u2019s success, Vajpayee remained ethereally calm and unwaveringly focused on the objective of throwing out Pakistan from Kargil. National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra ensured that all Indian institutions worked harmoniously to achieve the national aim of defeating Pakistan in Kargil. External affairs minister Jaswant Singh led the diplomatic effort from the front. Foreign secretary K Raghunath, ever thoughtful, sharpened India\u2019s diplomatic arguments to profile Pakistan\u2019s irresponsibility.",
            "Pakistan foreign minister Sartaj Aziz visited Delhi in June even as the fighting was raging. He suggested a ceasefire and an examination of the Indian charge of LoC violation to the Indian leadership. Maintaining complete diplomatic courtesy, Vajpayee and Singh told Aziz that India would compel Pakistan to vacate the Kargil posts whatever be the cost, and Pakistan should see the writing on the wall. Vajpayee asked Aziz, \u201cHow did the Lahore bus reach Kargil?\u201d",
            "Pakistan\u2019s Kargil intrusion made no strategic sense. It was premised on the Pakistani army\u2019s prejudice that India (read Hindus) doesn\u2019t have the stomach for sustained and difficult military actions. Now, Pakistani analysts uniformly blame a group of generals for Kargil. The problem is that the army has not abandoned its prejudices, and is engaged in the vain pursuit of confronting India, harming Pakistan and the region.",
            "Vivek Katju is a former Indian ambassador. He was the joint secretary handling the Pakistan division, both during the Lahore Summit and the Kargil war, in the ministry of external affairs. ",

            "Across the area affected by the unusually high heat, people tried to cool off in lakes and rivers. ",

            "Paris, in particular, remains haunted by the early summer of 2003 when 15,000 deaths were blamed on the heat and the authorities were bitterly criticised for not mobilising fast enough. ",
            "\u201cWe need to take care of ourselves but above all others especially those who are alone, and be able to detect the first symptoms of heatstroke,\u201d said Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. ",

            "The June 26-28 blast of heat in France was four degrees Celsius hotter than an equally rare June heatwave would have been in 1900, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) team said this month.",
            "One study by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology said the deadly, weeks-long heatwave across northern Europe in 2018 would have been statistically impossible without climate change. "

            "ISLAMABAD:\u00a0Afghan Taliban are ready to send their delegation to Pakistan for a meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan if Islamabad extends formal invitation, the insurgent group that has been fighting against the US and Washington backed Kabul administration since 2001 announced on Thursday.",
            "\u201cPakistan is our neighbouring and Muslim country. We will definitely visit Pakistan if we are given formal invitation,\u201d Sohail Shahin, spokesperson of Taliban\u2019s Political Office in Doha, told BBC Urdu.",
            "\u201cTaliban representatives frequently undertake visits to neighbouring and regional countries,\u201d the spokesperson added. The militant group is currently holding talks with the US in Doha to find a political solution to the 18 year long war.",
            "The statement from Taliban came just a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan completed a \u2018successful\u2019 visit to the US. During his three-day visit, Afghan endgame remained on top of the agenda.",
            "While the US acknowledged Pakistan\u2019s role in facilitating the ongoing talks, the Trump administration now wants Islamabad to persuade Taliban for permanent ceasefire and intra-Afghan dialogue.",
            "Imran, before wrapping up the all-important visit to Washington, said he assured President Trump that Pakistan would do \u2018whatever in its power to facilitate the Afghan peace process.\u2019",
            "He also indicated that he would meet the Afghan Taliban to convince them for a peace deal.",

            "He said it was indeed a \u201cvery positive and successful visit.\u201d\u00a0 Relations between Pakistan and US were stalled at least since 2015, he admitted.",
            "\u201cI would reiterate that the intent to enhance bilateral relations between Pakistan and the US has been expressed and now the relevant mechanisms will begin functioning to work out details of implementation,\u201d the spokesperson added.",
            "On uproar in India after President Trump\u2019s claim that Indian PM Narendra Modi recently requested him to mediate on Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, the spokesperson urged India and its media to respond \u201cmaturely whenever the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is discussed\u201d.",
            "\u201cAs you have witnessed that soon after President Trump announced to play a mediatory role, different segments of Indian media started panicking and making all sorts of allegations.",
            "\u201cAs I said earlier, the only viable solution of Jammu and Kashmir dispute is through dialogue and diplomacy and full implementation of the UN Security Council Resolutions,\u201d Faisal said."
