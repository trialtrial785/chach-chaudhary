        "detailed_news": "KATHUA, Jul 20: The Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Saturday put the onus on the separatists to walk up to the negotiating table to end the existing stalemate vis-\u00e0-vis political initiative to resolve Kashmir imbroglio.His assertion came with a reminder that he had already made exhaustive efforts to bring them to dialogue table as the Home Minister of the country, (in first tenure of Modi-government). Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

In a series of motivational lectures, Thakur told students on Thursday that the decision to come to Bhadarwah to take part in the \"Sangam Youth Festival\" organised by the army changed her life forever as she decided to join the armed forces. Hailing from Billan Bowlian in Udhampur district, Thakur joined the IAF as a fighter pilot this year, one of the first few women in the country to have done so. Her motivational lectures, organised by the Rashtriya Rifles unit based at Bhadarwah, are inspiring youngsters, especially girls, in the state to make a mark in life. \u201cI decided that I had to go for it, whatever it took. I would want every young boy and girl wanting to become a fighter pilot to dream big,\u201d Thakur told. In her message to the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and PG College Bhadarwah, she said, \u201cYour dreams may seem unconquerable at the moment. But you must chase those so hard that they become reality.\u201d Stating that a \"combination of average qualities\" in her made her unique, Thakur said, \u201cI climbed the ladder step by step, committing some mistakes as well, but kept going as I learned it the hard way. Instead of mourning over your failures and get into self pity, you should work harder to achieve your goals.\u201d She said being an NCC cadet helped her keep her nerves in the most difficult situations. The lectures were followed by question-answer sessions with the students. Aarushi, a Class 12 science student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, said she always thought becoming a doctor was the only option for her but Thakur''s words changed that. \u201cI already feel like flying as joining the army is my childhood dream. I will definitely strive harder to make my dream a reality,\u201d she said. Komal Katal (27) of Garh Bhadarwah village said, \u201cI always wanted to join the Army but in this part of the state, I never got an opportunity to try my luck. Although I could not appear in AFCAT (Air Force Common Admission Test) because of the age bar, after attending the lecture of Jubiksha, I will work harder and give it a try to join the Territorial Army.\u201d Besides Thakur, Commanding Officer, 4 Rashtriya Rifles Colonel D D Pandey also shared his experiences with the students. \u201cYou should be passionate about your dreams and to reach your destination, you should not hesitate and think longer to take your first step. Just start your journey today and you will definitely reach your destination,\u201d he said."

            "The foreign minister was addressing a press conference in Washington after three consecutive meetings between the senior leadership of both countries.",
            "\"During this tour, the thing that I find unique is that these people have seen the US [Pakistani] community's closeness to this prime minister. You saw that there were thousands gathered in the Capital One arena. ",
            "\"Even in this very room, we have seen extremely powerful prime ministers and presidents in the past having to address empty chairs. ",
            "\"The point is, the people that came there and the love that they expressed \u2014 that was a message from overseas Pakistanis. I have never seen this kind of a show before. ",
            "\"This was a very positive message and we are very happy with it,\" Qureshi said. ",
            "According to Qureshi, the exchanges in all three sessions were frank and Pakistan's delegation was able to deliver the message they had come with, \"which was to present Pakistan's point of view, as there had been a long gap [in discussions between the two sides] as an interaction of this level had not taken place in the past five years. ",
            "\"For five years, the top leadership of the two countries had not met. Our country did not have a foreign minister and for five to six years we did not have any lobbyists appointed here \u2014 all of this led to a vacuum in the relationship between the two sides.\"",
            "Qureshi said that in an effort to further revive the relations between the two countries, a meeting with the Pak-US caucus will be held. \"The caucus, which has been dormant for a while, will be revived. I remember I had made a promise to this effect in this very room. I would like to mention Tahir Javed, who made tremendous efforts towards the caucus's revival.",
            "\"I just met with Javed, and he let me know that the number [of people in the caucus] has gone up to nearly 80 now. I can assure you that in the recent past, no Pakistani leader has had the opportunity to have this much interaction [with the US leadership] as Prime Minister Imran has had. The point of all this interaction is to put forward Pakistan's point of view. This is because the structure [of the US government] is federal in nature, so no matter what the Executive wishes, nothing can happen without the support of the legislature. ",
            "\"You also know that the [US] legislature has a high-level of ingress from India. This is evident if you look at their staff and their think tanks. Keeping this in mind, we will also try to increase our interaction over there.  ",
            "\"I have told our ambassador here that our embassy's interaction with Capital Hill should increase and be more effective than before.\"",
            "Talking about the seriousness from both countries towards rebuilding the relationship, Qureshi said: \"We cannot forget the fact that the relationship between the two countries was such that no door was being opened for us in the time of Alice Wells and Lisa Curtis. We used to ask for time [for discussions] and they were not ready to give that to us. That was the level [we were at] a few months ago, please understand that. Wasn't our stance the same at the time? Was our Foreign Office not the same at the time?",
            "\"From that, we have come this far. I am not saying that this sitting has completely changed the way things were for us. I am saying that a door that was completely shut for us ... a possibility has been created for that door to be opened. We have come here in all seriousness to rebuild this relationship. The stiffness that once existed in our relationship has been lessened. ",
            "\"You must remember that when Secretary [of State] [Mike] Pompeo visited Pakistan in August 2018 and when I reciprocated the visit in October 2018, we had said that it is our wish to reset our relationship. That's when people had said that on one hand there's the US South Asia Strategy, on the other there is this wish \u2014 it was deemed to be quite a contrast. Today we have seen a new beginning, a new chapter is being opened, we should take this positively and hope that things will get better.",
            "Speaking on the trade front, the foreign minister said: \"Interactions between two countries are heavily based on economic ties, which is why it is important that we now pay attention to economic diplomacy too \u2014 like I mentioned yesterday during my interaction with the investors.",
            "\"The world looks at economics and looks for ways to cater to its own economic needs, so we will try that we also move forward in that direction.\"",
            "When asked about US economic assistance which had been withdrawn in recent times, Qureshi said: \"The first thing that we need to see is why the [economic] programmes had stopped. It was because of the trust deficit that had been built between the two countries. ",
            "\"Now that we are making an effort to curb that deficit, we can hope that those programmes will be reinstated.\"",
            "Speaking of the FATF and the pressure being exerted on Pakistan, Qureshi said: \"The FATF's greatest focus is on money laundering. Prime Minister Imran Khan has openly said that the plight of South Asian countries lies in the fact that the elite class their takes the money that the country is making and the foreign assistance it gets and misuses it. They send their money out of the country through money laundering.",
            "\"America needs to help us out, keep a check on money laundering. Until that happens, the common man in third world countries will continue to suffer and poverty will remain on the rise there. These are words used by the prime minister himself today. He made these comments in today's sitting. This is his commitment, as far as money laundering is concerned.",
            "\"The other thing is terror financing. You all know what our stance is on that, we have paid a hefty price for it. We make very clear cut statements in this regard today. We have not come here to lie, nor have we come here to make promises that we cannot keep. There is no point in promising something that you cannot deliver on \u2014 that is what we have been doing in the past. We as a government will not promise that which we cannot deliver.",
            "\"That said, we want progress in both these things (against money laundering and terror financing). I don't know how much political will the previous governments had in these matters, but one thing is sure, the current government has a very strong will to move forward in these matters \u2014 and we have taken concrete measures in this regard. We even have told everyone about the measures we have taken. ",
            "\"However, there are limitations, but we are trying to get past those. Earlier, there was neither will nor capacity in this regard \u2014 now there is will and capacity is being built, so we believe there will be progress in this regard.\"",
            "Speaking of India's reaction to President Trump's offer to mediate between Pakistan and India over Kashmir, Qureshi said:",
            "\"Of course India has reacted this way, what else can we expect? They are hardly going to blow trumpets on the offer. India has always reacted this way, they do not want any sort of interference on the Kashmir matter. ",
            "\"They always say that they want bilateral talks on Kashmir, then they never come to the table for these talks. They do not want mediation and they do not want bilateral talks. ",
            "\"Pakistan's stance on the matter is very simple: we want peace, we want peace efforts, we believe that the only solution to the problem is through talks.\"",
            "Speaking of the current situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan's efforts to restore peace in its own tribal areas, Qureshi said:",
            "\"We all saw that right before the current [Pakistan] government elected, a new US policy was announced and in it, Pakistan was primarily blamed for the situation in Afghanistan. Our point of view is completely opposite to that. ",
            "\"We believe that the reasons for the Afghan situation are manifold. The internal situation within Pakistan plays a great role in their regional situation. Furthermore, we kept saying and now the world has seen that Pakistan has made huge efforts on our side of the border and cleansed our own areas. We have restored peace there and started reconstruction there, because of which, a number of people that had to repatriate from there have started returning to their homes.",
            "\"The latest example [of peace and normalcy] there is the election that took place in the tribal belt a couple of days ago. The best thing about those elections was that they were completely peaceful, no untoward incident was reported there. The second great thing about those elections was that a large number of people took part in the voting process there \u2014 including a lot of women. Thirdly, the results of those elections were accepted by everyone.\"",
            "The foreign minister also touched upon the matter of some candidates, wishing to be a part of PTI, that contested the election independently because they were not given a party ticket. \"Some candidates that have won independently wished to contest the election under the PTI banner. However, the party's committee made some decisions and was unable to provide them tickets. Those candidates then chose to contest the elections independently while saying that once they win, they would join the PTI and support it. Due to these claims, we believe that the PTI will be able to secure 10 out of the 16 seats that were contested upon. Five of those seats already belong to the PTI, the other five we will gain when the independents join us, as is their constitutional right after being notified by the election commission.\"",
            "\"The point of letting everyone know this is to show that the world and the people of the area have all witnessed and accepted these elections and appreciated the efforts the government has put into them.\"",
            "FM Qureshi's views on the matter differ from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, who said that strict action will be taken against PTI members that chose to contest the election independently. ",
            "Answering a question regarding the ISI and army chiefs' presence in the tour, the foreign minister said: \"This is actually not the first time that our country's [military] leadership has been part of our discussions with the US. ",
            "\"I remember clearly, when I was the foreign minister earlier, a strategic dialogue had taken place. In that dialogue, I was present with Hillary Clinton and our chief of army staff at the time, General Kayani, had been having a discussion in the same room with the US military leadership. So this has happened before and it is not out of the ordinary\"."

Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

In a series of motivational lectures, Thakur told students on Thursday that the decision to come to Bhadarwah to take part in the \"Sangam Youth Festival\" organised by the army changed her life forever as she decided to join the armed forces. Hailing from Billan Bowlian in Udhampur district, Thakur joined the IAF as a fighter pilot this year, one of the first few women in the country to have done so. Her motivational lectures, organised by the Rashtriya Rifles unit based at Bhadarwah, are inspiring youngsters, especially girls, in the state to make a mark in life. \u201cI decided that I had to go for it, whatever it took. I would want every young boy and girl wanting to become a fighter pilot to dream big,\u201d Thakur told. In her message to the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and PG College Bhadarwah, she said, \u201cYour dreams may seem unconquerable at the moment. But you must chase those so hard that they become reality.\u201d Stating that a \"combination of average qualities\" in her made her unique, Thakur said, \u201cI climbed the ladder step by step, committing some mistakes as well, but kept going as I learned it the hard way. Instead of mourning over your failures and get into self pity, you should work harder to achieve your goals.\u201d She said being an NCC cadet helped her keep her nerves in the most difficult situations. The lectures were followed by question-answer sessions with the students. Aarushi, a Class 12 science student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, said she always thought becoming a doctor was the only option for her but Thakur''s words changed that. \u201cI already feel like flying as joining the army is my childhood dream. I will definitely strive harder to make my dream a reality,\u201d she said. Komal Katal (27) of Garh Bhadarwah village said, \u201cI always wanted to join the Army but in this part of the state, I never got an opportunity to try my luck. Although I could not appear in AFCAT (Air Force Common Admission Test) because of the age bar, after attending the lecture of Jubiksha, I will work harder and give it a try to join the Territorial Army.\u201d Besides Thakur, Commanding Officer, 4 Rashtriya Rifles Colonel D D Pandey also shared his experiences with the students. \u201cYou should be passionate about your dreams and to reach your destination, you should not hesitate and think longer to take your first step. Just start your journey today and you will definitely reach your destination,\u201d he said."

            "\"During this tour, the thing that I find unique is that these people have seen the US [Pakistani] community's closeness to this prime minister. You saw that there were thousands gathered in the Capital One arena. ",
            "\"Even in this very room, we have seen extremely powerful prime ministers and presidents in the past having to address empty chairs. ",
            "\"The point is, the people that came there and the love that they expressed \u2014 that was a message from overseas Pakistanis. I have never seen this kind of a show before. ",
            "\"This was a very positive message and we are very happy with it,\" Qureshi said. ",
            "According to Qureshi, the exchanges in all three sessions were frank and Pakistan's delegation was able to deliver the message they had come with, \"which was to present Pakistan's point of view, as there had been a long gap [in discussions between the two sides] as an interaction of this level had not taken place in the past five years. ",
            "\"For five years, the top leadership of the two countries had not met. Our country did not have a foreign minister and for five to six years we did not have any lobbyists appointed here \u2014 all of this led to a vacuum in the relationship between the two sides.\"",
            "Qureshi said that in an effort to further revive the relations between the two countries, a meeting with the Pak-US caucus will be held. \"The caucus, which has been dormant for a while, will be revived. I remember I had made a promise to this effect in this very room. I would like to mention Tahir Javed, who made tremendous efforts towards the caucus's revival.",
            "\"I just met with Javed, and he let me know that the number [of people in the caucus] has gone up to nearly 80 now. I can assure you that in the recent past, no Pakistani leader has had the opportunity to have this much interaction [with the US leadership] as Prime Minister Imran has had. The point of all this interaction is to put forward Pakistan's point of view. This is because the structure [of the US government] is federal in nature, so no matter what the Executive wishes, nothing can happen without the support of the legislature. ",
            "\"You also know that the [US] legislature has a high-level of ingress from India. This is evident if you look at their staff and their think tanks. Keeping this in mind, we will also try to increase our interaction over there.  ",

            "Talking about the seriousness from both countries towards rebuilding the relationship, Qureshi said: \"We cannot forget the fact that the relationship between the two countries was such that no door was being opened for us in the time of Alice Wells and Lisa Curtis. We used to ask for time [for discussions] and they were not ready to give that to us. That was the level [we were at] a few months ago, please understand that. Wasn't our stance the same at the time? Was our Foreign Office not the same at the time?",
            "\"From that, we have come this far. I am not saying that this sitting has completely changed the way things were for us. I am saying that a door that was completely shut for us ... a possibility has been created for that door to be opened. We have come here in all seriousness to rebuild this relationship. The stiffness that once existed in our relationship has been lessened. ",
            "\"You must remember that when Secretary [of State] [Mike] Pompeo visited Pakistan in August 2018 and when I reciprocated the visit in October 2018, we had said that it is our wish to reset our relationship. That's when people had said that on one hand there's the US South Asia Strategy, on the other there is this wish \u2014 it was deemed to be quite a contrast. Today we have seen a new beginning, a new chapter is being opened, we should take this positively and hope that things will get better.",
            "Speaking on the trade front, the foreign minister said: \"Interactions between two countries are heavily based on economic ties, which is why it is important that we now pay attention to economic diplomacy too \u2014 like I mentioned yesterday during my interaction with the investors.",
            "\"The world looks at economics and looks for ways to cater to its own economic needs, so we will try that we also move forward in that direction.\"",
            "When asked about US economic assistance which had been withdrawn in recent times, Qureshi said: \"The first thing that we need to see is why the [economic] programmes had stopped. It was because of the trust deficit that had been built between the two countries. ",
            "\"Now that we are making an effort to curb that deficit, we can hope that those programmes will be reinstated.\"",
            "Speaking of the FATF and the pressure being exerted on Pakistan, Qureshi said: \"The FATF's greatest focus is on money laundering. Prime Minister Imran Khan has openly said that the plight of South Asian countries lies in the fact that the elite class their takes the money that the country is making and the foreign assistance it gets and misuses it. They send their money out of the country through money laundering.",
            "\"America needs to help us out, keep a check on money laundering. Until that happens, the common man in third world countries will continue to suffer and poverty will remain on the rise there. These are words used by the prime minister himself today. He made these comments in today's sitting. This is his commitment, as far as money laundering is concerned.",
            "\"The other thing is terror financing. You all know what our stance is on that, we have paid a hefty price for it. We make very clear cut statements in this regard today. We have not come here to lie, nor have we come here to make promises that we cannot keep. There is no point in promising something that you cannot deliver on \u2014 that is what we have been doing in the past. We as a government will not promise that which we cannot deliver.",
            "\"That said, we want progress in both these things (against money laundering and terror financing). I don't know how much political will the previous governments had in these matters, but one thing is sure, the current government has a very strong will to move forward in these matters \u2014 and we have taken concrete measures in this regard. We even have told everyone about the measures we have taken. ",
            "\"However, there are limitations, but we are trying to get past those. Earlier, there was neither will nor capacity in this regard \u2014 now there is will and capacity is being built, so we believe there will be progress in this regard.\"",
            "Speaking of India's reaction to President Trump's offer to mediate between Pakistan and India over Kashmir, Qureshi said:",
            "\"Of course India has reacted this way, what else can we expect? They are hardly going to blow trumpets on the offer. India has always reacted this way, they do not want any sort of interference on the Kashmir matter. ",
            "\"They always say that they want bilateral talks on Kashmir, then they never come to the table for these talks. They do not want mediation and they do not want bilateral talks. ",
            "\"Pakistan's stance on the matter is very simple: we want peace, we want peace efforts, we believe that the only solution to the problem is through talks.\"",
            "Speaking of the current situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan's efforts to restore peace in its own tribal areas, Qureshi said:",
            "\"We all saw that right before the current [Pakistan] government elected, a new US policy was announced and in it, Pakistan was primarily blamed for the situation in Afghanistan. Our point of view is completely opposite to that. ",
            "\"We believe that the reasons for the Afghan situation are manifold. The internal situation within Pakistan plays a great role in their regional situation. Furthermore, we kept saying and now the world has seen that Pakistan has made huge efforts on our side of the border and cleansed our own areas. We have restored peace there and started reconstruction there, because of which, a number of people that had to repatriate from there have started returning to their homes.",
            "\"The latest example [of peace and normalcy] there is the election that took place in the tribal belt a couple of days ago. The best thing about those elections was that they were completely peaceful, no untoward incident was reported there. The second great thing about those elections was that a large number of people took part in the voting process there \u2014 including a lot of women. Thirdly, the results of those elections were accepted by everyone.\"",
            "The foreign minister also touched upon the matter of some candidates, wishing to be a part of PTI, that contested the election independently because they were not given a party ticket. \"Some candidates that have won independently wished to contest the election under the PTI banner. However, the party's committee made some decisions and was unable to provide them tickets. Those candidates then chose to contest the elections independently while saying that once they win, they would join the PTI and support it. Due to these claims, we believe that the PTI will be able to secure 10 out of the 16 seats that were contested upon. Five of those seats already belong to the PTI, the other five we will gain when the independents join us, as is their constitutional right after being notified by the election commission.\"",
            "\"The point of letting everyone know this is to show that the world and the people of the area have all witnessed and accepted these elections and appreciated the efforts the government has put into them.\"",
            "FM Qureshi's views on the matter differ from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, who said that strict action will be taken against PTI members that chose to contest the election independently. ",
            "Answering a question regarding the ISI and army chiefs' presence in the tour, the foreign minister said: \"This is actually not the first time that our country's [military] leadership has been part of our discussions with the US. ",
            "\"I remember clearly, when I was the foreign minister earlier, a strategic dialogue had taken place. In that dialogue, I was present with Hillary Clinton and our chief of army staff at the time, General Kayani, had been having a discussion in the same room with the US military leadership. So this has happened before and it is not out of the ordinary\"."

Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

In a series of motivational lectures, Thakur told students on Thursday that the decision to come to Bhadarwah to take part in the \"Sangam Youth Festival\" organised by the army changed her life forever as she decided to join the armed forces. Hailing from Billan Bowlian in Udhampur district, Thakur joined the IAF as a fighter pilot this year, one of the first few women in the country to have done so. Her motivational lectures, organised by the Rashtriya Rifles unit based at Bhadarwah, are inspiring youngsters, especially girls, in the state to make a mark in life. \u201cI decided that I had to go for it, whatever it took. I would want every young boy and girl wanting to become a fighter pilot to dream big,\u201d Thakur told. In her message to the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and PG College Bhadarwah, she said, \u201cYour dreams may seem unconquerable at the moment. But you must chase those so hard that they become reality.\u201d Stating that a \"combination of average qualities\" in her made her unique, Thakur said, \u201cI climbed the ladder step by step, committing some mistakes as well, but kept going as I learned it the hard way. Instead of mourning over your failures and get into self pity, you should work harder to achieve your goals.\u201d She said being an NCC cadet helped her keep her nerves in the most difficult situations. The lectures were followed by question-answer sessions with the students. Aarushi, a Class 12 science student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, said she always thought becoming a doctor was the only option for her but Thakur''s words changed that. \u201cI already feel like flying as joining the army is my childhood dream. I will definitely strive harder to make my dream a reality,\u201d she said. Komal Katal (27) of Garh Bhadarwah village said, \u201cI always wanted to join the Army but in this part of the state, I never got an opportunity to try my luck. Although I could not appear in AFCAT (Air Force Common Admission Test) because of the age bar, after attending the lecture of Jubiksha, I will work harder and give it a try to join the Territorial Army.\u201d Besides Thakur, Commanding Officer, 4 Rashtriya Rifles Colonel D D Pandey also shared his experiences with the students. \u201cYou should be passionate about your dreams and to reach your destination, you should not hesitate and think longer to take your first step. Just start your journey today and you will definitely reach your destination,\u201d he said."

            "Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Tuesday said United States President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to visit Pakistan extended to him by Prime Minister Imran Khan.",
            "The foreign minister was addressing a press conference in Washington after three consecutive meetings between the senior leadership of both countries.",
            "\"During this tour, the thing that I find unique is that these people have seen the US [Pakistani] community's closeness to this prime minister. You saw that there were thousands gathered in the Capital One arena. ",
            "\"Even in this very room, we have seen extremely powerful prime ministers and presidents in the past having to address empty chairs. ",
            "\"The point is, the people that came there and the love that they expressed \u2014 that was a message from overseas Pakistanis. I have never seen this kind of a show before. ",
            "\"This was a very positive message and we are very happy with it,\" Qureshi said. ",
            "According to Qureshi, the exchanges in all three sessions were frank and Pakistan's delegation was able to deliver the message they had come with, \"which was to present Pakistan's point of view, as there had been a long gap [in discussions between the two sides] as an interaction of this level had not taken place in the past five years. ",
            "\"For five years, the top leadership of the two countries had not met. Our country did not have a foreign minister and for five to six years we did not have any lobbyists appointed here \u2014 all of this led to a vacuum in the relationship between the two sides.\"",
            "Qureshi said that in an effort to further revive the relations between the two countries, a meeting with the Pak-US caucus will be held. \"The caucus, which has been dormant for a while, will be revived. I remember I had made a promise to this effect in this very room. I would like to mention Tahir Javed, who made tremendous efforts towards the caucus's revival.",
            "\"I just met with Javed, and he let me know that the number [of people in the caucus] has gone up to nearly 80 now. I can assure you that in the recent past, no Pakistani leader has had the opportunity to have this much interaction [with the US leadership] as Prime Minister Imran has had. The point of all this interaction is to put forward Pakistan's point of view. This is because the structure [of the US government] is federal in nature, so no matter what the Executive wishes, nothing can happen without the support of the legislature. ",
            "\"You also know that the [US] legislature has a high-level of ingress from India. This is evident if you look at their staff and their think tanks. Keeping this in mind, we will also try to increase our interaction over there.  ",
            "\"I have told our ambassador here that our embassy's interaction with Capital Hill should increase and be more effective than before.\"",
            "Talking about the seriousness from both countries towards rebuilding the relationship, Qureshi said: \"We cannot forget the fact that the relationship between the two countries was such that no door was being opened for us in the time of Alice Wells and Lisa Curtis. We used to ask for time [for discussions] and they were not ready to give that to us. That was the level [we were at] a few months ago, please understand that. Wasn't our stance the same at the time? Was our Foreign Office not the same at the time?",
            "\"From that, we have come this far. I am not saying that this sitting has completely changed the way things were for us. I am saying that a door that was completely shut for us ... a possibility has been created for that door to be opened. We have come here in all seriousness to rebuild this relationship. The stiffness that once existed in our relationship has been lessened. ",
            "\"You must remember that when Secretary [of State] [Mike] Pompeo visited Pakistan in August 2018 and when I reciprocated the visit in October 2018, we had said that it is our wish to reset our relationship. That's when people had said that on one hand there's the US South Asia Strategy, on the other there is this wish \u2014 it was deemed to be quite a contrast. Today we have seen a new beginning, a new chapter is being opened, we should take this positively and hope that things will get better.",
            "Speaking on the trade front, the foreign minister said: \"Interactions between two countries are heavily based on economic ties, which is why it is important that we now pay attention to economic diplomacy too \u2014 like I mentioned yesterday during my interaction with the investors.",
            "\"The world looks at economics and looks for ways to cater to its own economic needs, so we will try that we also move forward in that direction.\"",
            "When asked about US economic assistance which had been withdrawn in recent times, Qureshi said: \"The first thing that we need to see is why the [economic] programmes had stopped. It was because of the trust deficit that had been built between the two countries. ",
            "\"Now that we are making an effort to curb that deficit, we can hope that those programmes will be reinstated.\"",
            "Speaking of the FATF and the pressure being exerted on Pakistan, Qureshi said: \"The FATF's greatest focus is on money laundering. Prime Minister Imran Khan has openly said that the plight of South Asian countries lies in the fact that the elite class their takes the money that the country is making and the foreign assistance it gets and misuses it. They send their money out of the country through money laundering.",
            "\"America needs to help us out, keep a check on money laundering. Until that happens, the common man in third world countries will continue to suffer and poverty will remain on the rise there. These are words used by the prime minister himself today. He made these comments in today's sitting. This is his commitment, as far as money laundering is concerned.",
            "\"The other thing is terror financing. You all know what our stance is on that, we have paid a hefty price for it. We make very clear cut statements in this regard today. We have not come here to lie, nor have we come here to make promises that we cannot keep. There is no point in promising something that you cannot deliver on \u2014 that is what we have been doing in the past. We as a government will not promise that which we cannot deliver.",
            "\"That said, we want progress in both these things (against money laundering and terror financing). I don't know how much political will the previous governments had in these matters, but one thing is sure, the current government has a very strong will to move forward in these matters \u2014 and we have taken concrete measures in this regard. We even have told everyone about the measures we have taken. ",
            "\"However, there are limitations, but we are trying to get past those. Earlier, there was neither will nor capacity in this regard \u2014 now there is will and capacity is being built, so we believe there will be progress in this regard.\"",
            "Speaking of India's reaction to President Trump's offer to mediate between Pakistan and India over Kashmir, Qureshi said:",
            "\"Of course India has reacted this way, what else can we expect? They are hardly going to blow trumpets on the offer. India has always reacted this way, they do not want any sort of interference on the Kashmir matter. ",
            "\"They always say that they want bilateral talks on Kashmir, then they never come to the table for these talks. They do not want mediation and they do not want bilateral talks. ",
            "\"Pakistan's stance on the matter is very simple: we want peace, we want peace efforts, we believe that the only solution to the problem is through talks.\"",
            "Speaking of the current situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan's efforts to restore peace in its own tribal areas, Qureshi said:",
            "\"We all saw that right before the current [Pakistan] government elected, a new US policy was announced and in it, Pakistan was primarily blamed for the situation in Afghanistan. Our point of view is completely opposite to that. ",
            "\"We believe that the reasons for the Afghan situation are manifold. The internal situation within Pakistan plays a great role in their regional situation. Furthermore, we kept saying and now the world has seen that Pakistan has made huge efforts on our side of the border and cleansed our own areas. We have restored peace there and started reconstruction there, because of which, a number of people that had to repatriate from there have started returning to their homes.",
            "\"The latest example [of peace and normalcy] there is the election that took place in the tribal belt a couple of days ago. The best thing about those elections was that they were completely peaceful, no untoward incident was reported there. The second great thing about those elections was that a large number of people took part in the voting process there \u2014 including a lot of women. Thirdly, the results of those elections were accepted by everyone.\"",
            "The foreign minister also touched upon the matter of some candidates, wishing to be a part of PTI, that contested the election independently because they were not given a party ticket. \"Some candidates that have won independently wished to contest the election under the PTI banner. However, the party's committee made some decisions and was unable to provide them tickets. Those candidates then chose to contest the elections independently while saying that once they win, they would join the PTI and support it. Due to these claims, we believe that the PTI will be able to secure 10 out of the 16 seats that were contested upon. Five of those seats already belong to the PTI, the other five we will gain when the independents join us, as is their constitutional right after being notified by the election commission.\"",
            "\"The point of letting everyone know this is to show that the world and the people of the area have all witnessed and accepted these elections and appreciated the efforts the government has put into them.\"",
            "FM Qureshi's views on the matter differ from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, who said that strict action will be taken against PTI members that chose to contest the election independently. ",
            "Answering a question regarding the ISI and army chiefs' presence in the tour, the foreign minister said: \"This is actually not the first time that our country's [military] leadership has been part of our discussions with the US. ",
            "\"I remember clearly, when I was the foreign minister earlier, a strategic dialogue had taken place. In that dialogue, I was present with Hillary Clinton and our chief of army staff at the time, General Kayani, had been having a discussion in the same room with the US military leadership. So this has happened before and it is not out of the ordinary\"."
