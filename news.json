Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

            "PRIME MINISTER Imran Khan and US President Donald Trump presented quite a spectacle when they came together at the White House earlier this week. Much has been said and written about the chemistry, charisma and clarity on show, the absurdity of it all seemingly a side note. Pakistan, the US and the world at large appears to have got used to a new normal.",
            "The Indian subcontinent was ruled by the British for almost 200 years. For much of that time, ordinary Indians \u2014 and this included large segments of the educated elite \u2014 thought it was perfectly normal for a few thousand white men to rule over hundreds of millions of Indians. We imbibed the colonial logic that British rule was necessary for otherwise backward Indian natives to be ushered into the modern age. To put it simply, we were convinced by Rudyard Kipling\u2019s infamous myth of \u2018the white man\u2019s burden\u2019.",
            "Then came a political awakening, a recognition that colonialism was in fact not a blessing, but a curse \u2014 our resources expropriated, our bodies and minds enslaved, the freedom movement struggled for a new normal to be established. The end of the British Raj heralded exactly that.",
            "What followed was a country called Pakistan, in which sons and daughters of the soil would enjoy the right to self-determination and the excesses of colonialism would give way to peace and justice for all. This never happened, an emergent military establishment and a pliant coterie of political elites representing continuity rather than change. Yet, a new normal took root anyway: all Pakistanis were equal and free in name, but unequal and un-free in reality.",
            "The new normal  has been pushed even further to the right.",
            "A similar parallel existed at the global level. The era of European colonialism had ended, all nations in principle equal and free. But in practice the dominance of Euro-American societies was intact, and the ex-colonies subject to the whims of an emergent informal empire, Washington its capital.",
            "At different points over the past 70 years, what is considered normal has changed, both in Pakistan and around the world. Most notably, in the late 1960s and 1970s, ordinary working people believed firmly that they could come together and change the world, to fulfil the promise of national liberation movements and revolutionary struggles at their peak. Domestic ruling classes and imperialist powers could be upended by the wretched of the earth. ",
            "It was perfectly normal for ordinary people to believe that the world could be changed, and to dedicate themselves to doing so. This represented such a threat to entrenched elites everywhere that a new normal had to be forged yet again. From the 1980s onwards, ruling classes all over the world presided over a period of great repression. More importantly, a new normal was propagated through media, education and other means \u2014 that a world free of exploitation and injustice is an impossibility. ",
            "By the 1990s, younger generations had come to believe that There is No Alternative (TINA). Margaret Thatcher insisted that the idea that we share of collective interests is simply hogwash, a distraction from the imperative of individual advancement. ",
            "Today, we have seen the new normal pushed even further to the right of Thatcher, thanks to Trump, Khan, Modi, Duarte, Erdogan and the most recent member of the new populist club to acquire governmental power, Boris Johnson. Whether they admit it or not, these upstarts have little understanding of the deep contradictions of the global order, or their own conflict-ridden societies. They engage in a politics of name-calling and sensationalism, Trump\u2019s boast that he could kill 10m Afghans a classic example. Herd behaviour is the result, large numbers of ordinary people poisoned into believing that the new normal of Trump, Khan, Modi, etc is actually an affront to the status quo, when in fact it is simply exacerbating inequality, injustice and un-freedom. ",
            "Mercifully, societies are not monoliths, so whenever a new draconian normal takes root, there are always forces who speak out for the oppressed. But it is clear that as more and more ordinary people become integrated into a digital political sphere in which melodrama rules, states and corporations will become more adept at manipulating \u2018public opinion\u2019 in ways that even European colonial rulers could never have imagined. ",
            "Pakistan is a perfect example. For most of the last two decades, the media, the political right and state institutions have stoked an anti-American narrative across society. Over the past few days, we have been convinced that all is well now that Trump likes Imran Khan. For his part, the prime minister insists that the whole country, including the armed forces, are with him. Apparently, those with a different point of view are troublemakers preventing Pakistan from attaining peace and prosperity. Sounds like something Trump would say, doesn\u2019t it? ",
