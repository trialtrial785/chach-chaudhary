Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

In a series of motivational lectures, Thakur told students on Thursday that the decision to come to Bhadarwah to take part in the \"Sangam Youth Festival\" organised by the army changed her life forever as she decided to join the armed forces. Hailing from Billan Bowlian in Udhampur district, Thakur joined the IAF as a fighter pilot this year, one of the first few women in the country to have done so. Her motivational lectures, organised by the Rashtriya Rifles unit based at Bhadarwah, are inspiring youngsters, especially girls, in the state to make a mark in life. \u201cI decided that I had to go for it, whatever it took. I would want every young boy and girl wanting to become a fighter pilot to dream big,\u201d Thakur told. In her message to the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and PG College Bhadarwah, she said, \u201cYour dreams may seem unconquerable at the moment. But you must chase those so hard that they become reality.\u201d Stating that a \"combination of average qualities\" in her made her unique, Thakur said, \u201cI climbed the ladder step by step, committing some mistakes as well, but kept going as I learned it the hard way. Instead of mourning over your failures and get into self pity, you should work harder to achieve your goals.\u201d She said being an NCC cadet helped her keep her nerves in the most difficult situations. The lectures were followed by question-answer sessions with the students. Aarushi, a Class 12 science student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, said she always thought becoming a doctor was the only option for her but Thakur''s words changed that. \u201cI already feel like flying as joining the army is my childhood dream. I will definitely strive harder to make my dream a reality,\u201d she said. Komal Katal (27) of Garh Bhadarwah village said, \u201cI always wanted to join the Army but in this part of the state, I never got an opportunity to try my luck. Although I could not appear in AFCAT (Air Force Common Admission Test) because of the age bar, after attending the lecture of Jubiksha, I will work harder and give it a try to join the Territorial Army.\u201d Besides Thakur, Commanding Officer, 4 Rashtriya Rifles Colonel D D Pandey also shared his experiences with the students. \u201cYou should be passionate about your dreams and to reach your destination, you should not hesitate and think longer to take your first step. Just start your journey today and you will definitely reach your destination,\u201d he said."

            "The prime minister said that Pakistan would continue to work with the US to promote the Afghan peace process, but it would not be easy. Pakistan was trying its best to get the Taliban engaged not just with the US but also with the Afghan government and would continue to do so, said Mr Khan.",

It was organised by the Pakistan caucus, which is co-chaired by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat, and Congressman James Banks, a Republican. The caucus made elaborate arrangements for PM Khan\u2019s first visit to the Hill, with halal food \u2014 sushi and vegetable samosas included \u2014 arranged neatly on one side, and non-alcoholic drinks on the other.",

            "In his recent interaction with Prime Minister Imran Khan, Donald Trump spoke about the Afghan issue \u2014 a concern that largely shapes the Trump administration\u2019s views vis-\u00e0-vis Pakistan. ",
            "However, what Mr Trump said has raised a furore of sorts, with the Afghan government seeking clarification of his comments. ",
            "Perhaps meaning to indicate his lack of appetite for further foreign wars, the US president said while meeting Mr Khan that he could easily win the Afghan conflict but did not \u201cwant to kill 10m people\u201d, while adding that the US could wipe Afghanistan \u201coff the face of the earth\u201d. ",
            "Whatever Mr Trump meant to say, his comments have come across as arrogant and insensitive; oddly, the presidential bluster comes as the US peace envoy is headed to Kabul for talks with the Afghan Taliban.",
            "Unfortunately, the US has been unable to extricate itself from Afghanistan for nearly two decades. ",
            "What started off as a mission to punish those supposedly involved in the Sept 11 terror attacks has transformed into an open-ended war; moreover, the Americans have also attempted nation-building in Afghanistan, trying to transplant a Western model of democracy in a tribal society already reeling from instability and war since the 1970s. ",
            "However, these attempts have failed to bear fruit, as the nation remains divided along ethno-linguistic lines, while the Taliban are said to control nearly half of the country. ",
            "The fact is that the US must acknowledge that its \u2018shock-and-awe\u2019 tactics in the country, and its attempts to engineer a political and social structure, have utterly failed. ",
            "Instead of making misguided comments about obliterating Afghanistan and killing millions of people, the American president needs to highlight a doable exit strategy. ",
            "Moreover, the American establishment must admit that its cavalier attempts at nation-building in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya were wrong and that its efforts have left these nations worse off.",
            "However, Mr Trump was right when he said Pakistan could help the US exit Afghanistan. ",
            "Indeed, this country has played and should continue to play a role in bringing peace to Afghanistan. ",
            "Moreover, instability in the latter has been one of the major factors behind the sociopolitical upheaval in Pakistan, especially in the wake of the Soviet invasion. ",
            "Yet while Pakistan, the US, and all neighbours of Afghanistan have key roles to play where facilitating peace between Kabul and the Taliban is concerned, the process needs to be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. ",
            "The shuttle diplomacy between Kabul, Doha and other cities is continuing to persuade the Taliban to sign a peace deal. ",
            "But the process is slow and painstaking, which is why foreign players must be careful about the comments they make, and not risk inflaming the situation with loose talk.",

He, however, said it was not an easy task. He said the entire country including the army and security forces are on the same page for the common objective of peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict.At a reception hosted by the Congressional Pakistan Caucus on Tuesday, the prime minister maintained that peace in the region was vitally important for the promotion of Pakistan&rsquo;s development agenda. He said that Pakistan had extended its full support to facilitate direct talks between the US and Taliban, which had made progress. He said Pakistan was in defensive position in this war so how could the demand to &lsquo;do more&rsquo; have been made to it. He added that the past governments did not express ground realities to the US.Hours before concluding his historical trip to the United States, Imran Khan visited the Capitol Hill, and addressed a number of Congress members including Sen Gary Peters, Sen Sherrod Brown and Sen Chris Van Hollen and several members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was introduced to members of the Caucus including Republican Co-Chair Rep Jim Banks (R-IN) and Democratic Co-Chair Rep Thomas Suozzi (D-NY).The prime minister also met with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also joined the event.Speaking at the reception, Imran Khan thanked the attendees for the warm welcome and said that his government was committed to rebuilding the relationship on the basis of mutual trust and mutual respect.The prime minister said that Pakistan had facilitated the Afghan peace and reconciliation process as peace and stability in Afghanistan was vital for Pakistan. While cautioning about the complicated nature of the process and possible challenges, he said that Pakistan will continue to extend all possible facilitation in the process.Extending a warm welcome, Speaker Pelosi said it was a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister of Pakistan to the US Capitol and to discuss the vital ties between &ldquo;our economies, people & nations.&rdquo;  During the meeting, views were exchanged on matters relating to the Pakistan-US relations and regional developments.The prime minister told the Speaker that through his visit to the United States, he intended to enhance better understanding and renew and reinvigorate long-standing ties between the two countries. He said that Pakistan would continue to work with the United States for building an enduring partnership and promoting regional stability.The prime minister also shared his vision of peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia. He stressed that this could be achieved through peaceful resolution of outstanding disputes and building stable and cooperative relationships.The members of Congress also appreciated Pakistan&rsquo;s invaluable contribution in the Afghan peace and reconciliation process. They appreciated the role of the Pakistani American community in the US. They presented the prime minister copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the prime minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the US and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the US.Congresswoman Jackson Lee thanked the Prime Minister for visiting the Congress and expressed the hope that relations between the two countries could be deepened by enhancing exchanges between the parliamentary representatives of both sides. They were of the view that Prime Minister Khan&rsquo;s visit to the Capitol will help generate greater interest and foster better understanding of Pakistan in the US Congress.Agencies add: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said after his visit and interaction with the US leadership, the people of America will have a better understanding about Pakistan. Speaking to the US Congressmen at the Capitol Hill, he said Pakistan had always close ties with the United States and expressed the hope to get back to the relationship, which was based on truth and trust as well as mutual respect.Imran Khan expressed the hope that from now onward, relationship between the two countries would be at different level. He said unfortunately, he felt that Pakistan was not understood there, specifically in the last 15 years when the war on terror was being fought in Afghanistan and on the border of Pakistan.More than 70,000 Pakistani people died and our economy suffered billions of dollars loss in the war against terror. The prime minister said over 40 terrorist groups came to Pakistan because of the US war that it fought and its own existence was endangered by it. He said Pakistan was fighting the US war on terror while Pakistan had nothing to do with the 9/11. Al Qaida was in Afghanistan and there were no militant Taliban in Pakistan. He said it was very important that he met President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and explained to them the way forward that the relationship has to be based on mutual trust.Prime Minister Imran Khan said he would meet with the Taliban after returning to his country, as part of efforts to end the 18 years of war in Afghanistan.He said he had also spoken with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and now, when he goes back, \"I will meet the Taliban and I will try my best to get them to talk to the Afghan government.\"Speaking at the US Institute for Peace, a bipartisan federal body, Khan said he had been contacted by the Islamist extremist Afghan Taliban \"a few months back\", after his election win in July 2018, but did not take a meeting at that time because Kabul was not in favor of it. The militants reached out to him \"because I always maintained there was no military solution\" to the war in Afghanistan, he said.\"So because of that, I had a certain amount of credibility amongst them,\" added Khan. Khan earlier Tuesday met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who emphasised the importance of working together and \"Pakistan&rsquo;s significant role in supporting the Afghan peace process and counterterrorism,\" according to a US statement.\"It&rsquo;s not going to be easy because there&rsquo;s no centralised command, it&rsquo;s a devolved movement,\" Khan cautioned about the insurgent group. \"But we feel that if we all work together, we feel this is the best chance of there to be peace in Afghanistan.\"Khan also stressed that Afghanistan&rsquo;s presidential election in September \"must be an inclusive election where the Taliban also participate\". A breakthrough could pave the way for a withdrawal of international troops about 18 years after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, which led the US to launch an offensive that dislodged the Taliban government from Kabul. \"Today, there is no concept in Pakistan of &lsquo;strategic depth&rsquo; because we feel that by interfering in Afghanistan... we have actually done a lot of damage to our own country,\" he said.At the reception, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while addressing the ceremony, said the role of Congress is vital to further fortify the ties between Pakistan and the United States. The prime minister left for home Tuesday evening after the three-day visit to Washington.Congressmen presented Imran Khan a copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the prime minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the US and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the US.\n\t\t\t",

        "brief": "\n\n\t\t\t\tISLAMABAD: Former CIA Director General David Petraeus has said that he is \"convinced\" that the Pakistani intelligence agencies did not know Osama bin Laden (OBL) was in Pakistan, countering Prime Minister Imran Khan's claims that the ISI provided a lead to the CIA that helped the US track down and kill the terror group al-Qaeda&rsquo;s chief in 2011.Imran Khan's statement on Osama bin Laden during an interview with Fox News on Monday was significant as Pakistan had so far denied that it had any information about the hideout of the al-Qaeda chief before he was killed in a covert raid by US Navy SEAL commandos in the garrison city of Abbottabad.According to media report, David Petraeus, during an interactive session at the Indian Consulate in New York City on Tuesday, asserted the US is convinced that the Pakistani intelligence was not aware that the terrorist leader was hiding in their country.\"We are quite convinced that the ISI, Pakistani intelligence, no one else knew that OBL was there in Pakistan. They were not harbouring him or hiding him or anything like that. We have very good insights on that. We probably differ with those who said that the Pakistanis were allowing him to live in that particular compound in Abbottabad,\" he said.David Petraeus said during counter-insurgency campaigns, Pakistani authorities could never close in on North Waziristan where terror outfits such as the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda and others had their headquarters.He said that the US learnt later on that OBL was not in that area but near the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad.\"I figured out later that I had probably flown right over his compound in a helicopter as I went to address the cadets at the military academy one time,\" he said, referring to the Pakistan Military Academy. David Petraeus said he hopes Imran Khan will be able to deal with the challenges of his country, where the economy is &ldquo;very distorted&rdquo; and where the \"realities of the situation are really quite difficult.\"\n\t\t\t",

        "brief": "\n\n\t\t\t\tISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday strongly rebuffed that the contents of a reference against a judge of the Supreme Court were leaked from the Aiwan-e-Sadr as he had held thorough investigation into it.In an interview with a private TV channel he explained that he had received the reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa, judge of the Supreme Court, moved by the Ministry of Law and Justice.To a question in that regard the President further elaborated that after receiving the reference, he had three options over its disposal. First to sit over it like those who used such things for blackmailing (threats), second for holding a media trial, and the third one to proceed in accordance with relevant laws.He said that he preferred the legal one by sending the presidential reference to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) under the specific laws and expressed the confidence that SJC would decide it in accordance with the law.To another question, the President credited Prime Minister Imran Khan for effectively representing Pakistan&rsquo;s stance on various issues including a peaceful resolution to the Afghan issue during his visit to the United States. He said during the prime minister&rsquo;s visit, comprehensive talks were held on the peaceful resolution of the Afghan issue. Pakistan had assured the US about making all out efforts to bring Taliban to hold dialogue for the peaceful solution of the issue, he said adding, the US wanted a peaceful exit from Afghanistan and afterward, Pakistan could assist in the rehabilitation and restructuring efforts.The president to a question said the prime minister had already reminded the world and the US particularly that war was no solution to the issues as it was easy to flare up the conflicts without any end in the sight. President Trump thought out of the box which was his quality, he added.Parting ways with the transactional ties, the prime minister rightly projected that Pakistan wanted to live among the comity of nations with dignity and self respect which also correlated with PTI&rsquo;s motive of transforming the country into modern, Islamic and welfare state.President Alvi said that he had regular interaction with the opposition parties. In response to a question, he said media had a greater role than any other organ in the country to bring about social change by highlighting the social issues. The media should show the people the difference between the good and bad. It should further enhance its role and play its effective part in the national building, he added.The president informed that he had asked Pemra to provide him ranking of those TV channels concentrating on the social issues, so that they could be awarded.To another question, he said the process for the plea bargain as envisaged under the National Accountability law must be more open and should not be reached behind the closed doors. To make his point, the president cited a decision of the Supreme Court in which it opted for an offer over land encroachment case with Malik Riaz, the property tycoon.The president also advocated women&rsquo;s inheritance rights by saying that relevant laws were not being implemented. Recommendations in that regard had been forwarded to the Islamic Ideology Council, he said, adding religious elements, media and the prayers leaders should also play their respective roles in that regard.About International Court of Justice&rsquo;s decision on convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, the president said that the Attorney General for Pakistan and people in the Law Ministry had the opinion that consular access should have been provided to him. The ICJ held the same which was expected.The president said being an ordinary man, he wanted promotion of new technology in Pakistan and would like to work for provision of health facilities and ensuring women&rsquo;s hereditary rights, besides making efforts aimed at catering to the needs of the special people.He opined that MQM had changed itself and only the time would prove it how much the party had reformed itself. He stressed upon televising of special programmes at the PTV for those people who were suffering from hearing impairment.The president to a query said that he and his spouse had learnt many things from Imran Khan and his wife, including their passion for the welfare work.\n\t\t\t",

        "brief": "\n\n\t\t\t\tTEHRAN: Iran&rsquo;s president has signalled a deal could be possible regarding the British-flagged tanker seized in the Strait of Hormuz.President Hassan Rouhani suggested on Wednesday that the Stena Impero vessel could be released if the UK takes similar steps to hand back an Iranian oil tanker seized by the Royal Navy off Gibraltar earlier this month.The remarks could help reduce tensions between the two countries as Boris Johnson takes over as Prime Minister. &ldquo;We do not seek the continuation of tension with some European countries,&rdquo; Rouhani said in comments carried on his website.&ldquo;Should they be committed to international frameworks and give up their wrong actions, including what they did in Gibraltar, they will receive a proportional response from Iran.&rdquo; Rouhani described the Iranian seizure of the UK-flagged Stena Impero as &ldquo;professional and brave&rdquo;.The comments came after the tanker&rsquo;s owners said the crew are safe following communications with them in Iran. The vessel was taken by Iran&rsquo;s Revolutionary Guard on Friday amid worsening relations between Tehran and the West.Stena Bulk confirmed it has had direct contact with the crew of the impounded vessel.The ship&rsquo;s master said they were all safe and there had been good cooperation with the Iranian personnel on board. Stena Bulk said the crew&rsquo;s family members were being kept updated on the latest developments and being offered the firm&rsquo;s full support. Erik Hanell, president and CEO of Stena Bulk, said: &ldquo;We do of course appreciate this step of development and that this is a first sign that we will soon see more positive progress from the Iranian authorities.&rdquo;The development came as the head of the Iranian supreme leader&rsquo;s office said the UK was sending a mediator to negotiate for the release of the vessel.&ldquo;A country that at one time appointed ministers and lawyers in Iran has reached a point where they send a mediator and plead for their ship to be freed,&rdquo; Mohammad Mohammadi-Golpayegani said, according to the semi-official Tasnim news site.UK sources insisted they were not aware of any mediator being sent to Iran, insisting that diplomatic contacts were through the ambassador and embassy in Tehran. .\n\t\t\t",

He, however; said it was not an easy task. He said the entire country including army and security forces are on same page for a common objective of peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. At a reception hosted by the Congressional Pakistan Caucus on Tuesday, the prime minister maintained that peace in the region was vitally important for the promotion of Pakistan&rsquo;s development agenda.He said that Pakistan had extended its full support to facilitate direct talks between the US and Taliban, which had made progress. He said Pakistan was in defensive position in this war so how could the demand to &lsquo;do more&rsquo; have been made to it. He added that the past governments did not express ground realities to the US.Hours before concluding his historical trip to the United States, Imran Khan visited the Capitol Hill, and addressed a number of Congress members including Sen Gary Peters, Sen Sherrod Brown and Sen Chris Van Hollen and several members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was introduced to members of the Caucus including Republican Co-Chair Rep Jim Banks (R-IN) and Democratic Co-Chair Rep Thomas Suozzi (D-NY).The prime minister also met with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also joined the event.

        "brief": "\n\n\t\t\t\tISLAMABAD: Former CIA Director General David Petraeus has said that he is \"convinced\" that the Pakistani intelligence agencies did not know Osama bin Laden (OBL) was in Pakistan, countering Prime Minister Imran Khan's claims that the ISI provided a lead to the CIA that helped the US track downContinued on page 4and kill the terror group al-Qaeda&rsquo;s chief in 2011. Imran Khan's statement on Osama bin Laden during an interview with Fox News on Monday was significant as Pakistan had so far denied that it had any information about the hideout of the al-Qaeda chief before he was killed in a covert raid by US Navy SEAL commandos in the garrison city of Abbottabad.According to media report, David Petraeus, during an interactive session at the Indian Consulate in New York City on Tuesday following his address on Indo-Pacific, asserted the US is convinced that the Pakistani intelligence was not aware that the terrorist leader was hiding in their country.\"We are quite convinced that the ISI, Pakistani intelligence, no one else knew that OBL was there in Pakistan. They were not harbouring him or hiding him or anything like that. We have very good insights on that. We probably differ with those who said that the Pakistanis were allowing him to live in that particular compound in Abbottabad,\" he said. David Petraeus said that during counter-insurgency campaigns, Pakistani authorities could never close in on North Waziristan where terror outfits such as the Haqqani network, al-Qaeda and others had their headquarters and some of their forces. He said that the US learnt later on that OBL was not in that area but near the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Abbottabad. \"I figured out later that I had probably flown right over his compound in a helicopter as I went to address the cadets at the military academy one time,\" he said, referring to the PMA. David Petraeus said he hopes Imran Khan will be able to deal with the challenges of his country, where the economy is &ldquo;very distorted&rdquo; and where the \"realities of the situation are really quite difficult.\"\n\t\t\t",

        "brief": "\n\n\t\t\t\tWASHINGTON: Prime Minister Imran Khan has assured members of the US Congress that Pakistan will continue to play its role to help achieve the shared objective of a political solution in Afghanistan.He said Pakistan was trying its level best to bring Taliban to the negotiating table and a significant achievement has been made in this regard. He, however; said it was not an easy task. He said the entire country including army and security forces are on same page for a common objective of peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict.At a reception hosted by the Congressional Pakistan Caucus on Tuesday, the prime minister maintained that peace in the region was vitally important for the promotion of Pakistan&rsquo;s development agenda. He said that Pakistan had extended its full support to facilitate direct talks between the US and Taliban, which had made progress. He said Pakistan was in defensive position in this war so how could the demand to &lsquo;do more&rsquo; have been made to it. He added that the past governments did not express ground realities to the US.Hours before concluding his historical trip to the United States, Imran Khan visited the Capitol Hill, and addressed a number of Congress members including Sen Gary Peters, Sen Sherrod Brown and Sen Chris Van Hollen and several members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was introduced to members of the Caucus including Republican Co-Chair Rep Jim Banks (R-IN) and Democratic Co-Chair Rep Thomas Suozzi (D-NY).The prime minister also met with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also joined the event.Speaking at the reception, Imran Khan thanked the attendees for the warm welcome and said that his government was committed to rebuild the relationship on the basis of mutual trust and mutual respect.The Prime Minister said that Pakistan had facilitated the Afghan peace and reconciliation process as peace and stability in Afghanistan was vital for Pakistan. While cautioning about the complicated nature of the process and possible challenges, he said that Pakistan will continue to extend all possible facilitation in the process.Extending a warm welcome, Speaker Pelosi said it was a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister of Pakistan to the US Capitol and to discuss the vital ties between &ldquo;our economies, people & nations.&rdquo; During the meeting, views were exchanged on matters relating to Pakistan-US relations and regional developments.The Prime Minister told the Speaker that, through his visit to the United States, he intended to enhance better understanding and renew and reinvigorate long-standing ties between the two countries. He said that Pakistan would continue to work with the United States for building an enduring partnership and promoting regional stability.The Prime Minister also shared his vision of peace, progress and prosperity in South Asia. He stressed that this could be achieved through peaceful resolution of outstanding disputes and building stable and cooperative relationships.The members of Congress also appreciated Pakistan&rsquo;s invaluable contribution in the Afghan peace and reconciliation process. They appreciated the role of the Pakistani American community in the US. They presented the Prime Minister copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the Prime Minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the U.S. and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the U.S.Congresswoman Jackson Lee thanked the Prime Minister for visiting the Congress and expressed hope that relations between the two countries could be deepened by enhancing exchanges between the parliamentary representatives of both sides. They were of the view that Prime Minister Khan&rsquo;s visit to the Capitol will help generate greater interest and foster better understanding of Pakistan in the US Congress.Agencies add: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said after his visit and interaction with the US leadership, the people of America will have better understanding about Pakistan. Speaking to the US Congressmen at the Capitol Hill, he said Pakistan had always close ties with the United States and expressed the hope to get back to the relationship, which was based on truth and trust as well as mutual respect.Imran Khan expressed the hope that from now onward relationship between the two countries would be at different level. He said unfortunately, he felt that Pakistan was not understood there, specifically in the last 15 years when the war on terror was being fought in Afghanistan and on the border of Pakistan.More than 70,000 Pakistani people died and our economy suffered billions of dollars loss in the war against terror. The Prime Minister said over 40 terrorist groups came to Pakistan because of the US war that it fought and its own existence was endangered by it. he said Pakistan was fighting the US war on terror while Pakistan had nothing to do with the 9/11. Al Qaida was in Afghanistan and there were no militant Taliban in Pakistan. He said it was very important that he met President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and explained to them the way forward that the relationship has to be based on mutual trust.Prime Minister Imran Khan said he would meet with the Taliban after returning to his country, as part of efforts to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan.He said he had also spoken with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and now, when he goes back, &ldquo;I will meet the Taliban and I will try my best to get them to talk to the Afghan government.&rdquo;Speaking at the US Institute for Peace, a bipartisan federal body, Khan said he had been contacted by the Islamist extremist Afghan Taliban &ldquo;a few months back&rdquo;, after his election win in July 2018, but did not take a meeting at that time because Kabul was not in favor of it.The militants reached out to him &ldquo;because I always maintained there was no military solution&rdquo; to the war in Afghanistan, he said.&ldquo;So because of that, I had a certain amount of credibility amongst them,&rdquo; added Khan. Khan earlier Tuesday met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who emphasised the importance of working together and &ldquo;Pakistan&rsquo;s significant role in supporting the Afghan peace process and counterterrorism,&rdquo; according to a US statement.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be easy because there&rsquo;s no centralised command, it&rsquo;s a devolved movement,&rdquo; Khan cautioned about the insurgent group. &ldquo;But we feel that if we all work together, we feel this is the best chance of there to be peace in Afghanistan.&rdquo;Khan also stressed that Afghanistan&rsquo;s presidential election in September &ldquo;must be an inclusive election where the Taliban also participate&rdquo;. A breakthrough could pave the way for a withdrawal of international troops about 18 years after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, which led the US to launch an offensive that dislodged the Taliban government from Kabul.&ldquo;Today, there is no concept in Pakistan of &lsquo;strategic depth&rsquo; because we feel that by interfering in Afghanistan... we have actually done a lot of damage to our own country,&rdquo; he said.At the reception, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while addressing the ceremony, said the role of congress is vital to further fortify the ties between Pakistan and the United States.The Prime Minister left for home Tuesday evening after the three-day visit to Washington. Congressmen presented Imran Khan a copy of the special resolution, which had been introduced in the Congress to welcome the prime minister&rsquo;s inaugural visit to the US and to reaffirm the continuing support and commitment to the long and enduring friendship between Pakistan and the US.\n\t\t\t",

        "brief": "\n\n\t\t\t\tISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday strongly rebuffed that the contents of a reference against a judge of the Supreme Court were leaked from the Aiwan-e-Sadr as he had held thorough investigation into it.In an interview with a private TV channel he explained that he had received the reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa, judge of the Supreme Court, moved by the Ministry of Law and Justice.To a question in that regard the President further elaborated that after receiving the reference, he had three options over its disposal. First to sit over it like those who used such things for blackmailing (threats), second for holding a media trial, and the third one to proceed in accordance with relevant laws. He said that he preferred the legal one by sending the presidential reference to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) under the specific laws and expressed the confidence that SJC would decide it in accordance with the law.To another question, the President credited Prime Minister Imran Khan for effectively representing Pakistan&rsquo;s stance on various issues including a peaceful resolution to the Afghan issue during his visit to the United States. He said during the prime minister&rsquo;s visit, comprehensive talks were held on the peaceful resolution of the Afghan issue. Pakistan had assured the US about making all out efforts to  bring Taliban to hold dialogue for the peaceful solution of the issue, he said adding, the US wanted a peaceful exit from Afghanistan and afterward, Pakistan could assist in the rehabilitation and restructuring efforts.The president to a question said the prime minister had already reminded the world and the US particularly that war was no solution to the issues as it was easy to flare up the conflicts without any end in the sight. President Trump thought out of the box which was his quality, he added.Parting ways with the transactional ties, the prime minister rightly projected that Pakistan wanted to live among the comity of nations with dignity and self respect which also correlated with PTI&rsquo;s motive of transforming the country into modern, Islamic and welfare state. during his visit to the United States. In a series of tweets, she said the prime minister during his US visit, strongly highlighted the importance of resolution of outstanding dispute.She said Shahbaz Sharif should have also learnt from the simplicity and austerity of Imran Khan instead of criticising him for riding on the buses.Dr Awan claimed the popularity of the prime minister was increasing amongst the masses despite Shahbaz Sharif&rsquo;s efforts to misguide the people out of enviousness. &ldquo;Shahbaz Sahab! You do gimmickry by walking on London roads and when return to Pakistan, you fall back on the habit of protocol,&rdquo; she contended.Meanwhile, Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Wednesday said that provision of rights to the people, who were entitled to them, was mission of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\t\t\t",
