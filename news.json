        "detailed_news": "KATHUA, Jul 20: The Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Saturday put the onus on the separatists to walk up to the negotiating table to end the existing stalemate vis-\u00e0-vis political initiative to resolve Kashmir imbroglio.His assertion came with a reminder that he had already made exhaustive efforts to bring them to dialogue table as the Home Minister of the country, (in first tenure of Modi-government). Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

In a series of motivational lectures, Thakur told students on Thursday that the decision to come to Bhadarwah to take part in the \"Sangam Youth Festival\" organised by the army changed her life forever as she decided to join the armed forces. Hailing from Billan Bowlian in Udhampur district, Thakur joined the IAF as a fighter pilot this year, one of the first few women in the country to have done so. Her motivational lectures, organised by the Rashtriya Rifles unit based at Bhadarwah, are inspiring youngsters, especially girls, in the state to make a mark in life. \u201cI decided that I had to go for it, whatever it took. I would want every young boy and girl wanting to become a fighter pilot to dream big,\u201d Thakur told. In her message to the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and PG College Bhadarwah, she said, \u201cYour dreams may seem unconquerable at the moment. But you must chase those so hard that they become reality.\u201d Stating that a \"combination of average qualities\" in her made her unique, Thakur said, \u201cI climbed the ladder step by step, committing some mistakes as well, but kept going as I learned it the hard way. Instead of mourning over your failures and get into self pity, you should work harder to achieve your goals.\u201d She said being an NCC cadet helped her keep her nerves in the most difficult situations. The lectures were followed by question-answer sessions with the students. Aarushi, a Class 12 science student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, said she always thought becoming a doctor was the only option for her but Thakur''s words changed that. \u201cI already feel like flying as joining the army is my childhood dream. I will definitely strive harder to make my dream a reality,\u201d she said. Komal Katal (27) of Garh Bhadarwah village said, \u201cI always wanted to join the Army but in this part of the state, I never got an opportunity to try my luck. Although I could not appear in AFCAT (Air Force Common Admission Test) because of the age bar, after attending the lecture of Jubiksha, I will work harder and give it a try to join the Territorial Army.\u201d Besides Thakur, Commanding Officer, 4 Rashtriya Rifles Colonel D D Pandey also shared his experiences with the students. \u201cYou should be passionate about your dreams and to reach your destination, you should not hesitate and think longer to take your first step. Just start your journey today and you will definitely reach your destination,\u201d he said."

            "\u2014 Shehbaz Sharif (@CMShehbaz) July 23, 2019",
            "In a separate statement issued on Tuesday, PML-N president said, \u201cImran wasted an important opportunity of sending a message of unity in his speeches in America. He should have talked about Pakistan and challenges that lie ahead but he chose to make petty and personal attacks on Nawaz.\u201d",
            "He said Imran Niaz\u2019s vision of bankruptcy was now clear. \u201cHis pettiness is clear from his statements that he wants to take away TV and air-conditioner from Nawaz.\u201d",
            "He said Imran had proven he was the most unfit person to hold the Prime Minister Office.",
            "\u201cImran Niazi is focusing more on gimmicks like riding on buses and less on substantive issues that matter to the people of Pakistan. Imran Niazi has once again taken U-turns on his own statements,\u201d said Shehbaz. \u201cThe PM talked about bringing Aafia Siddiqui home, but he did not want journalists to ask him questions.\u201d",
            "He said Imran had not mentioned resolution of Kashmir issue on the basis of UN resolutions. \u201cHas Imran changed Pakistan\u2019s policy on Kashmir? In America Imran exposed his dictatorial thinking by saying media needs to be controlled. He is lying by saying the media is free under his government while the media is suffering from the worst kind of censorship,\u201d he added.",
            "Shehbaz demanded of the PM to explain to the nation how he had offered to \u201cdo more\u201d for America.",
            "\u201cWhen Nawaz Sharif talked about better relations with India, Imran called him \u2018Modi\u2019s yaar\u2019, but now he is following the vision of Nawaz,\u201d he added.",
            "Nawaz\u2019s vision was better relations with all neighbours. \u201cImran Niazi is now following Nawaz\u2019s vision,\u201d he added. \u201cHe has achieved nothing in his visit to America except proving he is unfit to be the prime minister of this country. He has proved he is a selected prime minister.\u201d",
            "In separate statement, PML-N Information Secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb said, \u201cThe imposed dictatorial regime of the selected prime minister cannot succeed by denying freedom of expression and locking down the entire opposition and every voice of criticism.\u201d",
            "Marriyum said if such tactics could guaranteed success of an imposed regime, dictatorships from 1958 till 2019 would have never ended. \u201cIf the country could have been run by choking freedom of the press and subjecting opposition to worst political victimisation, Musharraf would have been a lifetime ruler of Pakistan,\u201d she added.",
            "The former information minister urged Imran not to malign the concept of a democratic republic through his fascist mindset.",
            "These tactics, she said, could not solve the crisis of survival faced by the people of Pakistan who were struggling to feed their families courtesy to the PTI\u2019s economic policy disasters.",
            "\u201cYou cannot silence the misery of 220 million people living in Pakistan because of your failures even if you continue putting opponents behind bars and shutting down the media,\u201d said Marriyum. \u201cThe nation is in a state of despair with soaring inflation, rising unemployment, crippling unfair taxes and lies of the selected prime minister and his army of rented spokespersons.\u201d"
