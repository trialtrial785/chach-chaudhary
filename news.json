        "brief": "",
        "date": "Updated July 29, 2019",
        "detailed_news": [
            "LAST week, several news outlets reported comments made by the chairperson of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority on the organisation\u2019s troubles in \u2018managing\u2019 content over the internet. The initial story that came out suggested that the PTA chief, a retired major general, had suggested exploring options utilised by countries like the UAE and China, where major social media platforms are either banned or heavily regulated. Later on, a flurry of inchoate clarifications issued by the organisation stressed that these were used as examples and that the PTA has no intention of banning internet platforms in Pakistan.",
            "The entire exchange, which happened in front of a Senate special committee, makes several references to blasphemous content hosted outside of Pakistan as the main source of frustration for the telecom regulator. While considered a serious matter, it is worth remembering that a similar debate led to a multi-year ban on YouTube under the PPP government, placing a significant freeze on content production and creation in Pakistan.",
            "Even if we take the most benign interpretation of the PTA\u2019s statement, it doesn\u2019t take much to see through the bugbear as a mere foothold in the larger conversation around regulating Pakistan\u2019s internet sphere. And it doesn\u2019t take much to see why the internet is proving to be a source of considerable consternation to the Pakistani state at this point.",
            "Regulating the internet under the pretext of hurt Muslim sentiment is something the state has been pushing for some time.",
            "It doesn\u2019t take much to see that the China or Bangladesh or Burma model, whichever one is in vogue at this point, occupies many important minds.",
            "It received extra credence in the highly securitised atmosphere of the last decade, when anti-state jihadi content appeared as another cause for regulatory concern. The outcome, one that many are now familiar with, was the ill-thought-out Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act 2016, which was passed with considerable consensus by the previous, PML-N-led government. In the long list of things the party should be regretting, now that it\u2019s on the other side of the quash, this should be pretty high up on the list.",
            "As highlighted by Ramsha Jahangir in an excellent online piece for this publication, PECA 2016 arms the regulator to assert its control by bypassing more thorough and consultative procedures for banning internet content. As a piece of legislation, PECA echoes the larger, danda-driven ethos of the Pakistani state on issues of political conflict, which has become all the more apparent in the last 12 months. What is this approach? Essentially, if you don\u2019t like something, ban it, incarcerate it, and don\u2019t let it see the light of day.",
            "None of this is to suggest that the issue of how a state (any state) interacts with internet content is straightforward. In countries like Pakistan, where physical violence against minorities of several types is common, provocations on and through the internet are a public policy issue that need to be resolved.",
            "But the pathway to resolution needs to be based on principles that are, at the very least, enshrined in the Constitution. To put it as briefly as possible, one unelected bureaucrat, appointed by an opaque process that was likely influenced by his former rank and institutional affiliation, cannot be making decisions that impact millions of internet users in the country. At the very least, it needs to be consultative and subject to transparent guidelines that can be debated and amended as and when the situation demands.",
            "On the other hand, this entire episode (and what\u2019s gone on for the last three years with cyberspace in Pakistan as a whole), and in particular the examples that were cited in front of the Senate panel, provides us with a window into what the Pakistani state aspires to become.",
            "IR scholars have pointed out that norm diffusion is a powerful explanatory mechanism to understand how military and civilian leaders) make certain decisions. Norms often emanate from state-to-state power relations, with the more powerful ones providing blueprints for the less powerful ones. In Pakistan\u2019s case, with increasing proximity to China and the Gulf, born out of our economic and geostrategic imperatives (or should one call them handicaps?), some of what defines those states is going to appear attractive to our decision-makers as well.",
            "This was something that people have highlighted at various points in the recent past as well. Authoritarianism is not something extraneous to the Pakistani state. The country has a long and illustrious (sic) history of centralising authority and utiliding coercion to achieve political objectives. What makes the current moment more pronounced is the perception of severity of the \u2018national situation\u2019. In other words, decision-makers now act on the sentiment that the country had become too soft, corrupt, and hollow in dealing with certain economic and political issues, and, therefore, needs a firmer grip on the handle to navigate through to eternal salvation.",
            "The PTA hearing made the analogies explicit, but it doesn\u2019t take much to see that the China or Bangladesh or Burma model, whichever one is in vogue at this point, occupies many important minds. On paper, Pakistan is a parliamentary democracy, but such a remarkable one that every important decision is being taken by unelected technocrats, bureaucrats, and military officers of various shades. ",
            "To address and resolve this dissonance, I submit a fairly straightforward request: let those who wish to control this model, and those who wish to play along with it, come out with an institutional plan that suggests a new legal architecture for the state. The dissonance as it stands now just produces confusion and increases transaction costs. If the desire is to have a unitary state for however long, at least be open about it. That would allow citizens and politicians alike to engage with the actual truth, rather than switching back and forth between what is real and what is for show. ",

        "detailed_news": "KABUL: An Afghan official on Sunday said the government would hold its first-ever direct talks with the Taliban within two weeks, but the latter quickly denied any such meeting was planned and reiterated their opposition to negotiating with the government representatives.The Taliban have been holding peace talks with the US for nearly a year but have refused to recognise the Kabul government, viewing it as an American puppet. Abdul Salam Rahimi, Afghanistan's state minister for peace affairs, said a 15-member government delegation will meet with the Taliban in Europe, without elaborating.The Taliban, however, rejected direct peace talks with the Afghan government and reiterated their demand of complete US forces&rsquo; pullout from the war-battered Afghanistan for intra-Afghan talks.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said there had been no agreement on such a meeting and that had not been coordinated with Taliban.He said once they reach an agreement with the US, they would be open to intra-Afghan talks, but any government representatives would have to participate in a personal capacity.Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban&rsquo;s political office in Qatar, said talks with Kabul would only come after the departure of US forces under a deal.Khalilzad said on Twitter that after the US concludes its agreements, intra-Afghan negotiations would take place between the Taliban and &ldquo;an inclusive and effective national negotiating team consisting of senior government officials, key political party representatives, civil society and women&rdquo;.He said it would include the Taliban and \"an inclusive and effective national negotiating team consisting of senior government officials, key political party representatives, civil society and women.\"Khalilzad has held several rounds of direct talks with the Taliban in Qatar since late last year with the focus on a Taliban demand for withdrawal of US and other foreign forces and a US demand the Taliban guarantee that Afghanistan will not be used as a base for terrorism.Two other main issues in the peace process are a ceasefire and Taliban&rsquo;s talks with the Afghan government. But the Taliban have refused to talk to the Afghan government, terming it a US puppet.There are reports that the US and Taliban are going to sign an MoU this week to firm up a plan for withdrawal of foreign troops.On Sunday, Taliban guerrillas destroyed police checkpoints killing at least seven policemen and civilians in an attempt to seize control of a district in Ghazni."

        "detailed_news": "ISLAMABAD: The Taliban and the United States have choreographed an agreement to bring nearly 18 years of military intervention and bloodshed in Afghanistan to an end, as the latter will provide a schedule for withdrawal of its troops.In all probabilities, the historic accord would be inked in Doha, Qatar on Thursday (August 1).The draft of agreement is being fine-tuned by the two sides before its formal announcement and signing.Senior Pakistani diplomats will be present in Doha on the occasion of signing of the accord.The accord will pave the way for further enhancing the peace process that will ensure ceasefire and an undertaking by the Taliban that their areas of influence would not be used by any terror group for activities in the country or beyond its frontiers.Highly placed diplomatic sources told The News Sunday evening that Mulla Abdul Ghani Brather will lead the Taliban, while the US Special Representative to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad will be heading the US team to sign the deal.Brather is already in Doha.The intra-Afghan negotiations will culminate in an agreement for the future system in the war-ravaged country.Khalilzad has already discussed with the Afghan government the \"next steps in the peace process, including identifying a national negotiating team that can participate in intra-Afghan negotiations,\" during his recent trip to Afghan capital Kabul, the sources pointed out.The next two weeks will be crucial regarding future of peace in Afghanistan.Taliban leader Mulla Haibatullah might travel to Pakistan for his all-important meetings here, including Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javaid Bajwa, whereas President Ashraf Ghani&rsquo;s administration will have a maiden interaction with the Taliban leaders in Kabul.The presidential election in Afghanistan, which has been deferred twice and now September 28 has been fixed for the schedule of the presidential poll, could yet another time be postponed for facilitating Taliban to take part in the process.The sources reminded that the 8th round of talks between the Taliban and the US in Doha will be initiated today (Monday) and for the purpose Zalmay Khalilzad is traveling to Doha who has already submitted an extensive report to President Donald Trump and State Department in Washington last week.According to estimates, more than 31,000 civilian deaths have been reported in the 18-year Afghan war.Reports suggest that 29,900 civilians have been wounded. More than 111,000 Afghans, including civilians, soldiers and militants, are estimated to have been killed in the conflict.A total of seven US military members have died in Afghanistan in 2019 so far. In March, two soldiers were killed. Currently, the US has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan.The sources revealed that the conflicting parties had agreed on so-called &ldquo;Road-map for peace in Afghanistan.&rdquo;Forming such a team is a fraught issue, as the Taliban have been refusing to negotiate directly with the Afghan government.Washington is hoping for a political agreement with the armed groups in Afghanistan ahead of the Afghan presidential election scheduled for late September.A breakthrough could pave way for withdrawal of international troops some 18 years after the 9/11 attacks, which led the US to invade Afghanistan to dislodge the Taliban government from Kabul.Zalmay Khalilzad has had several meetings with the Taliban in the past year, the most recent being in second week of this month.Earlier, the Taliban and other senior Afghan officials held intra-Afghan talks in the Qatari capital, pledging to deliver a \"road map for peace\" in Afghanistan.US President Donald Trump voiced optimism last week that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan could help broker a political settlement to end the war.\"I think Pakistan is going to help us out to extricate ourselves,\" Trump said, with Khan sitting next to him on Monday last at the start of a White House meeting."

        "detailed_news": "KABUL: The start of Afghanistan&rsquo;s election season was marred by deadly violence Sunday, just hours after President Ashraf Ghani insisted &ldquo;peace is coming&rdquo; to the war-torn nation.At least two people were killed and 25 others wounded in an attack targeting the Kabul office of Ghani&rsquo;s running mate, Amrullah Saleh. The violence came on the official starting day of campaign season for the upcoming presidential elections, serving as a grim reminder of Afghanistan&rsquo;s woeful security situation and the sort of mayhem and murder that have beset previous polls.The attack began around 4:40 pm, when a huge blast struck near the Green Trend office, a youth- and reform-focused civil society organisation Saleh heads. He escaped without serious injury, his office said. Three hours later, the attack was still ongoing. No group immediately claimed responsibility. &ldquo;The security forces have cordoned off the area. The security forces are trying to kill the attackers as soon as possible,&rdquo; interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said.Health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar said at least two people had been killed and 25 wounded.Earlier on Sunday, a buoyant Ghani kicked off his campaign by insisting &ldquo;peace is coming&rdquo; and that pivotal talks with the Taliban would take place. He is hoping to fend off challenges from 17 other candidates to score a second term at twice-postponed presidential elections now slated for September 28. On Saturday, Ghani&rsquo;s peace minister, Abdul Salam Rahimi, said direct talks would take place with the Taliban within two weeks as part of a larger, US-led push for peace. Such a development could be crucial, as the Taliban -- who now control or influence about half of Afghanistan -- have so far refused to speak to Ghani&rsquo;s government, as they consider the Kabul administration illegitimate. War aside, the country faces a host of major issues ahead of the election, including rocketing crime, a lacklustre economy, soaring unemployment, and crumbling infrastructure.Voters are despondent about the prospects of a fair election, and many worry about a repeat of the sort of violent attacks on previous polling stations by the Taliban and other insurgent groups trying to undermine Afghanistan&rsquo;s fragile democracy. Ghani insisted this year&rsquo;s election would be &ldquo;clean&rdquo;, but distrust is rife.Sayed Jan, a 27-year-old student, said he won&rsquo;t be voting as he has lost faith since the 2014 election that was mired in allegations of fraud and ballot stuffing. &ldquo;We have been betrayed by the candidates in the past, we cannot trust them this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need peace in Afghanistan instead of elections. Even if I vote, the election will be fraudulent.&rdquo;In Kabul, security forces fanned out across the city as leading candidates held rallies. Ghani&rsquo;s top rival is Abdullah Abdullah, who currently serves as the president&rsquo;s chief executive under an awkward power-sharing arrangement brokered by the US after the 2014 election. &ldquo;It is our national and religious duty to take advantage of any opportunities for peace,&rdquo; Abdullah told a campaign rally.One crucial issue is that the elections happen at all: they were postponed twice this year and further delays could lead to more distrust. Despite Ghani&rsquo;s claim that a summit between his government and the Taliban would take place shortly, the insurgents said they would only talk to Kabul after the US had announced a timeline for a withdrawal of foreign forces -- a key part of any deal. &ldquo;The Kabul administration will be considered a political side, just like others, and not a government,&rdquo; Taliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheen wrote in Pashto on Twitter.Diplomatic sources have said the Afghan-Taliban talks are scheduled to begin in Oslo on August 7.US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who is leading a push to forge a peace deal with the Taliban, said Saturday that new &ldquo;intra-Afghan&rdquo; negotiations would only take place after the US and Taliban had concluded their own agreements.He is expected to fly to Doha next week for what would be the eighth round of direct US-Taliban talks.Other presidential candidates include Ghani&rsquo;s former national security advisor Hanif Atmar and former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, nicknamed the &ldquo;Butcher of Kabul&rdquo; for his alleged role in the killing of thousands of people in the capital in the 1990s."
