            "The US, which invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban in 2001, wants to withdraw thousands of troops and turn the page on its longest-ever war. ",
            "But it would first seek assurances from the insurgents that they would renounce Al-Qaeda and stop other militants like the Islamic State group using the country as a haven. ",
            "The talks, now in their eighth round, began on Saturday and were due to resume Sunday morning after pausing overnight, US and Taliban sources told AFP. ",
            "A Taliban source also said efforts were underway to organise a direct meeting between US envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban co-founder Mullah Baradar, who heads the movement's political wing. ",
            "A coalition led by Washington ousted the Taliban in late 2001 accusing it of harbouring Al-Qaeda jihadists who claimed the September 11 attacks against the US that killed almost 3,000 people. ",
            "But despite a rapid conclusion to the conventional phase of the war, the Taliban have proved formidable insurgents, bogging down US troops for years. ",
            "Washington is hoping to strike a peace deal with the Taliban by September 1 \u2014 ahead of Afghan polls due the same month, and US presidential elections due in 2020. ",
            "US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that \"we've made a lot of progress. We're talking\". ",
            "\"We are pursuing a peace agreement not a withdrawal agreement, a peace agreement that enables withdrawal,\" Khalilzad tweeted on Friday as he arrived in Doha after talks with Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad. ",
            "\"Our presence in Afghanistan is conditions-based, and any withdrawal will be conditions-based.\"",
            "In another sign of progress, the Afghan government has formed a negotiating team for separate peace talks with the Taliban that diplomats hope could be held as early as later this month. ",
            "The Washington Post reported on Thursday that an initial deal to end the war would see the US force in Afghanistan reduced to as low as 8,000 from the current level of around 14,000. ",
            "In exchange, the Taliban would abide by a ceasefire, renounce Al-Qaeda, and talk to the Kabul administration. \nAn Afghan official hinted last week that the government of President Ashraf Ghani was preparing for direct talks with the Taliban, the details of which have yet to be announced. ",
            "\"We have no preconditions to begin talks, but the peace agreement is not without conditions,\" Ghani wrote in Pashto on his Facebook page on Friday ahead of the talks. ",
            "\"We want a republic government not an emirate,\" he said, a challenge to the Taliban which has insisted on reverting to the \"Islamic Emirate\" name Afghanistan bore under its rule. ",
            "\"The negotiations will be tough, and the Taliban should know that no Afghan is inferior in religion or courage to them.\"",
            "The thorny issues of power-sharing with the Taliban, the role of regional powers including Pakistan and India, and the fate of Ghani's administration also remain unresolved. ",
            "The latest US-Taliban encounter follows last month's talks between influential Afghans and the Taliban which agreed a \"roadmap for peace\" \u2014  but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire. ",
            "Kabul resident Somaya Mustafa, 20, said her country desperately needed a peace deal, but only one in which the Taliban \"accept women and their achievements\".",
            "\"It is a total mess in our country right now. And if it continues, women will suffer more than anyone else.\"",
            "The United Nations has said that civilian casualty rates across Afghanistan matched record levels last month, following a dip earlier in the year."

            "THE news emerging from India-held Kashmir is not good. ",
            "From the looks of it, the Hindu nationalist BJP government in New Delhi is preparing to up the ante in the occupied territory by pouring in troops. ",
            "Read: India's troop buildup triggers panic among residents in occupied Kashmir",
            "According to media reports, Delhi recently sent 25,000 military personnel to the held region; this is in addition to the 10,000 troops that were reportedly stationed in IHK last week. Moreover, tourists and Hindu pilgrims have been told to leave the region due to \u2018terror threats\u2019. ",
            "Read: Anxious tourists flee occupied Kashmir after India's 'terror' warning",
            "Naturally, this disturbing series of events has created alarm in IHK. There have been calls to stock up on food and fuel, which has led to panic buying, while in another development, details were recently leaked of an order to police from the rulers in Delhi to keep an eye on mosques and preachers. To this explosive situation we can add the fact that India is regularly violating the ceasefire along the Line of Control, while the BJP intends to scrap a crucial article of the Indian constitution that prevents outsiders from buying property in IHK. The signs, therefore, do not inspire hope.",
            "It is no secret that the ideological fountainhead of the BJP is the Hindu fascist RSS. Are the worrying developments in Kashmir a reflection of the Sangh Parivar\u2019s intentions in the occupied region? Does Prime Minister Narendra Modi plan to throw all democratic conventions to the wind in order to fulfil the agenda of his ideological parent, and appease his populist voter base? There are many indications of this. By doing away with Article 35A of the Indian constitution, the BJP will open up the floodgates for massive demographic changes in IHK, as the native population will be overwhelmed by outsiders. If the hardliners in Delhi think this will be a masterstroke through which they will \u2018conquer\u2019 Kashmir, they are mistaken. Such moves will only take Kashmiri disaffection with India to new heights; already cries for azadi are ringing out in the held valley. Perhaps fearing massive resistance from Kashmiris to its malevolent intentions, the Indian state is further strengthening its military presence in the heavily militarised region.",
            "Unfortunately, the Indian establishment appears to have traded in reason and sagacity for arrogance and brute force in IHK. ",
            "The increased troop presence and the plans to alter Kashmir\u2019s constitutional status will be a recipe for disaster. Kashmiris \u2014 especially the youth \u2014 have had enough of India\u2019s brutality and are willing to sacrifice their lives in their quest for freedom and dignity.",
            "But there is still time; if Mr Modi and his cohorts so wish, they can pull back and extend the hand of dialogue to the Kashmiris and Pakistan. Sanity demands that India reject confrontation and adopt negotiation and peacemaking instead. Will those who matter in Delhi pursue the course of sanity?",
