            "Pakistan currently bars dual citizens from running for parliament. Article 63-1(c) of the Constitution says that \"A person shall be disqualified from being elected or chosen as, or being a member of the Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament) if he ceases to be a citizen of Pakistan, or acquires the citizenship of a foreign state.\" ",
            "The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is now proposing an amendment to this clause. Many are accusing the PTI of taking another u-turn as Prime Minister Imran Khan has vehemently opposed such a move on many occasions in the past. While the charge carries weight, the more important issue is whether the move itself makes sense on rational grounds.",
            "This debate must be viewed from a human rights perspective which argues that the basic rights enjoyed by people by virtue of their citizenship must only be curtailed based on strong public security reasons. ",
            "Editorial: Lawmakers\u2019 nationality",
            "Democracies generally give priority to citizen rights over security concerns unless such concerns are serious and demonstrable. However, they avoid preemptively abrogating the basic rights of whole groups of citizens based on weak suspicions of possible future wrongdoings by them. Contesting elections is one such basic citizenship right.",
            "Pakistan allows dual citizenship, but it stripped dual citizens off the right to contest elections \u2014 something that's available to all other law-abiding adult citizens \u2014 in the 1973 Constitution. ",
            "Thus, there is a very large qualitative difference between the two categories of persons barred from contesting elections \u2014 from specific individuals who have already committed a crime (Pakistan bans citizens from running for office if they are \"found guilty of a corrupt or illegal practice under any law,\" among other things) to a whole group of persons who have not yet committed any crime. So, this is a preemptive ban.",
            "In some cases, states do preemptively curtail some rights, but usually for brief periods, if the risk is high. So how high is the risk that dual citizens will actually harm Pakistan\u2019s interests if they are allowed to become legislators? ",
            "Related: Class, race and romance in the Pakistani diaspora ",
            "To answer this question, one must look at evidence from countries which have been allowing dual citizens to contest elections for decades, including most of the 19 countries with which Pakistan allows dual citizenship. ",
            "In doing so, one finds no evidence that legislators with dual citizenship are usually or even often treasonous. In fact, dual citizens served even in Pakistani legislatures for several decades before the ban started being applied in earnest after 2008. But even from Pakistan, there is no evidence that any dual-citizen legislator played a treasonous role. ",
            "People give the examples of Shaukat Aziz and Moeen Qureshi as dual-citizen politicians who harmed Pakistan\u2019s interests and fled abroad. However, it is not established as fact that they held second passports. ",
            "Furthermore, while one can criticise some of their specific policies, it is hard to argue that their policies were more harmful than those of our other civilian and military rulers, some of whom also fled abroad despite not holding dual citizenship.",
            "Read next: Not every diaspora Pakistani can donate $1,000. But even if Diamer-Bhasha reaches its funding goal, then what?",
            "Dual citizenship can potentially create multiple loyalties. However, when someone has to make a choice, he/she can also prioritise one\u2019s country of birth, present residence and high-level political involvement over the country where one is merely a naturalised, non-resident or ordinary citizen. ",
            "People argue that the American oath requires renouncing previous loyalties and bearing arms. Adapted from 16th century British oaths, it has become antiquated and unenforceable. The United States started allowing dual citizenship in 1967 (for Pakistanis, a formal treaty in this regard was signed between Washington and Islamabad in 2002) which means that immigrants can retain previous allegiances and run for public offices. The country also abolished its conscription laws in 1973.",
            "The potential minor risks associated with dual citizens do not justify preemptive, lifetime and group-wide bans. At most, some precautionary measures would suffice. ",
            "The concern is that people who have no ties or investment in Pakistan may become legislators. To address it, the parliament could mandate residency and tax filing requirements of two or three years before one could become a legislator or cabinet member. ",
            "These requirements would apply not only to dual citizens but to all Pakistanis, including those who may be living abroad on long-term work or residency visas. Even otherwise, it is unlikely that anyone could win an election in Pakistan without fulfilling such residency requirements and developing roots in a particular constituency. ",
            "This would make it impossible for persons without any stakes or residency in Pakistan to be appointed to reserved assembly and senate seats or as governors, cabinet advisers or special assistants. ",
            "Dual citizens could also be barred from certain sensitive elected and non-elected executive positions, such as prime and foreign ministers, rather than ordinary parliament seats which individually have limited authority.  ",
            "View from the diaspora: At Imran's US jalsa, only the containers were missing ",
            "One finds no rational reason or evidence for depriving dual citizens of their basic right to contest elections. In fact, the arguments in favour are part of the xenophobia that swept Pakistan once ties with Western countries deteriorated after 2008. This is borne by the fact that there was little effort to apply the bar on dual citizens before that year. ",
            "Now, as ties start to mend after Imran Khan's visit to the US, it is hoped that this xenophobia will start to recede. Not only should Pakistan permit dual citizens to contest elections, it should also increase the number of countries with which dual citizenship is allowed.",
            "With globalisation, dual citizenship is becoming more common and beneficial for not only the individuals but also the countries involved. Pakistan should join the trend more prominently. ",

            "Details were not immediately available as to what specific steps Pakistan had taken to facilitate the peace process but officials familiar with the development told The Express Tribune that Islamabad had started executing the measures agreed between Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Donald Trump recently at a summit meeting in Washington.",
            "Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghan reconciliation, made a stopover in Islamabad where he was briefed about Pakistan\u2019s recent measures.",
            "Khalilzad, who is soon to resume talks with the Taliban in Doha, held talks with Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and separately met the premier.",
            "The PM, before meeting Khalilzad, also chaired a high-powered huddle attended by army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt General Faiz Hamid and other senior officials.

            "Trump had invited Imran to the White House as a token of recognition of Pakistan\u2019s positive role in facilitating the Afghan peace process as Islamabad\u2019s effort had helped the US and Taliban to come close to a deal.",
            "It is believed that the upcoming round in Doha will culminate into the signing of an MoU between the US and Taliban on the timeframe for troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, and Taliban guarantees of not allowing Afghan soil to be used by terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda.",
            "Officials here said Khalilzad apprised the Pakistani authorities about the likely deal with the Taliban and the future course of action. Once the broader deal is struck, the next phase of talks would be on bringing all Afghan groups on one platform.",
            "Taliban have so far rejected repeated calls for holding direct talks with the Ghani administration, although they met other rival groups and even government figures but in their individual capacities.",
            "But with the deal all set to be signed, it is likely that the Taliban, through the help of Pakistan, would now agree to meet the Ghani administration. The meeting is expected to take place sometime next week in Oslo, according to reports.",
            "Foreign Minister Qureshi welcomed the progress achieved in the talks and the Intra-Afghan Peace Conference in Doha, in which all participants agreed upon a basic road map.",
            "It was noted that ultimately the intra-Afghan dialogue would be vital to reach an agreement where Afghanistan becomes a stable, peaceful and prosperous country. It was also stressed that taking the Afghan peace process forward remained a shared responsibility, according the foreign office.",
            "An official handout said that during the meeting with Khalilzad, PM Imran reiterated Pakistan\u2019s commitment to remain engaged with the US and other stakeholders in facilitating the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan.",

            "While there are differing views about the PM\u2019s recent US visit, any realistic assessment must recognise two undeniable positive outcomes: one, that instead of the usual American mantra to \u201cdo more\u201d against the Taliban, Pakistan is being asked to facilitate an Afghan peace settlement through dialogue which is consistent with Pakistan\u2019s own policy; and, two, Trump\u2019s previous South Asia strategy of relying on India to secure Afghanistan has been replaced by recognition of Pakistan\u2019s central role in this process. Therefore, the dynamics of the Pakistan-US relations have changed from confrontation to cooperation. The key to developing a sustainable partnership will, however, depend upon the ability of both sides to resolve the Afghan conflict. This is by no means certain, as the road ahead has several obstacles to be overcome.",
            "The most serious challenge will be to reach and implement a sustainable Afghan peace settlement. With Pakistan\u2019s crucial assistance, the US-Taliban talks have made significant progress, involving timeframe for US troop withdrawal and Taliban commitment to eliminate terrorism from the Afghan soil. But the Americans also want the Taliban to engage in direct talks with the Afghan government and accept a ceasefire, for which they seek Pakistan\u2019s help to persuade the Taliban. It remains to be seen whether Pakistan can do so in the forthcoming talks with the Taliban leadership. So far, the Taliban have only agreed to an intra-Afghan dialogue and not just with the Afghan government, after the US withdrawal agreement has been announced. None of the sides have agreed to a ceasefire either. Meanwhile, an \u201cunofficial\u201d intra-Afghan dialogue in July reached agreement on a \u201croadmap\u201d for peace in Afghanistan. This meeting was the continuation of efforts by Pakistan, the US, Russia and China. But the details of the roadmap still need to be worked out and implemented. Given the continuing differences among the Afghans on issues such as power sharing and the mechanism for the transition to a broad-based government as well as the baggage of the past ethnic and sectarian rivalries, implementation of the road-map will face serious difficulties.",
            "There could also be the negative role of spoilers like India and perhaps, Iran. While the latter could be brought on board on the grounds that they want to ensure the US forces exit from their neighbourhood, the former has a vested interest in preventing any role for the Taliban in a future Afghan government since they view the Taliban as Pakistan\u2019s allies. Moreover, having been effectively dealt out of an Afghan agreement, India does not want an Afghan settlement that would help improve the Pakistan-US relations. For these reasons, India could use its Afghan allies to scuttle an agreement.",
            "Another challenge confronting Pakistan is the negative role of the American establishment which has used Pakistan as a scapegoat for its failure in Afghanistan. Its negative narrative continues to allege that Pakistan has \u201cdeceived\u201d the US and wants to use the Taliban to \u201ccontrol\u201d Afghanistan. Due to this hostility, no joint statement could be agreed upon during the PM\u2019s visit. Allied to the establishment is the Indo-American lobby in the US Congress, media and think-tanks.",
            "There is also the danger that a rogue terrorist attack on US troops in Afghanistan, or a false-flag Indian operation within India or occupied Kashmir could be blamed on Pakistan and may derail Pakistan\u2019s improving relations with the US. The Indians are quite capable of using their terrorist proxies like the TTP and the BLA to carry out such subversion. The \u201cterrorism\u201d issue which was noticeably on the back burner during the PM\u2019s meeting with Trump could resurface and deviate from the real focus on an Afghan settlement.",
            "From a broader perspective, both countries would face the challenge of reconciling their respective approaches to each other. While Pakistan continues to seek a long-term strategic partnership with the US, the Americans are pursuing the short-term tactical goal of an Afghan settlement with Pakistan\u2019s help. Moreover, in the growing rivalry between the US and China, Washington has engaged in a strategic partnership with New Delhi to contain China, whereas Islamabad maintains a strategic relationship with Beijing.",
            "To overcome these diverse challenges, Pakistan must, first of all, use every available leverage with the Afghans, including the Taliban, to conclude and implement a sustainable peace agreement in that country. At the same time, we need to be clear that we can only persuade but cannot compel the Afghans to resolve their differences. To strengthen our efforts, we must also involve like-minded countries, especially China and Russia, to achieve an Afghan accord. Such a concerted effort would also be useful to defeat Indian machinations to derail the process.",
            "Firm control would be needed against rogue elements within the country to overcome the charge of terrorism and prevent the realignment with the US from being derailed. This would also help Pakistan get off the FATF grey list and the UN\u2019s terrorism listing. To demonstrate its cooperation, the US has also acted against the BLA which is a positive development. Concurrently, Pakistan needs to highlight the Indian and Afghan role in supporting terrorism through the TTP and the BLA, especially in view of the recent attacks on our troops.",
            "The PM\u2019s personal rapport with Trump together with direct lines of communication with the White House would help neutralise the hostile American administration and anti-Pakistan lobbies. Success on the Afghan issue will further neutralise these critics.",
            "With regard to the global strategic context, Pakistan ought to position itself to benefit from the dynamics of superpower confrontation. Pakistan\u2019s geopolitical location and possession of nuclear weapons are attributes that the US cannot ignore. Similarly, our strategic partnership with China, especially the implementation of CPEC, is a major factor for Pakistan\u2019s security and stability. Moreover, beyond the Afghan issue, the US would still need Pakistan\u2019s cooperation for counterterrorism and the larger interest of regional peace and security.",
            "A good beginning has been made by the PM\u2019s visit to reset relations with the US. Now we need to move forward on the road ahead.",
