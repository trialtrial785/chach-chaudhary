        "detailed_news": "KATHUA, Jul 20: The Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Saturday put the onus on the separatists to walk up to the negotiating table to end the existing stalemate vis-\u00e0-vis political initiative to resolve Kashmir imbroglio.His assertion came with a reminder that he had already made exhaustive efforts to bring them to dialogue table as the Home Minister of the country, (in first tenure of Modi-government). Now it\u2019s for them (separatists) to act to make things move - whatever way, he plainly told when queried about stand-off on the need of political initiative in Kashmir after effectively containing militancy in the Valley, as claimed by the government. The Defence Minister was speaking to media persons after inaugurating the 1000-meter long Ujh bridge along the International Border (IB) in Kathua district. \u201cWhat stand-off..? There\u2019s no stand-off. Jitni Pehl Iss Desh Key Griha-Mantri Ko Karni Chahiye Thi Utni Pehl To Maine Pehle Kardi\u2026 Ab Uskay Baad Woh Faisla Karengay Key Kya Karna Hai.. (The efforts and initiatives, expected from the Home Minister of this country, have already been exhausted by me in my tenure as the Union Home Minister\u2026 Now it is for them to take a call as what they want to do\u2026),\u201d he said.  Responding to another query related to \u201cOperation All\u2013Out\u201d in the Valley to weed-out terrorism, Rajnath said that day was not far off to achieve that mark. \u201cThere are no two opinions about it that the Kashmir will get rid of terrorism very soon. Rest assured\u2026.it\u2019s going to happen very soon. More so, I believe- as in case of any act of terror occurring anywhere in the world, the way the international community is rallying around on one platform, joining hands to take on this threat, it (terrorism) will be wiped out of - not only Kashmir, Jammu ...but the entire world,\u201d he said.What was that challenge which was main obstacle in resolving Kashmir, in the Defence Minister\u2019s opinion as he had earlier served as the Union Home Minister also? Faced with this query, Rajnath said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to analyse that challenge here. Whatever be the challenge, it will be tackled. We very well know all the reasons, we\u2019ll sort them out and J&K will be rid of terrorism, for sure.\u201d   In response to queries related to recurrent ceasefire violations by Pakistan on IB and LoC, even on the day of his visit to J&K today and the probability of another Kargil-like misadventure by the neighbouring nation (Pak), his terse reply was, \u201cThis message is for all the countrymen- Have faith in our country\u2019s leadership - the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the valiant jawans and officers of our armed forces. They will not let down your faith in them.\u201dEarlier he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just returned from Kargil. Accompanied by the Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and Union Minister of State in PMO Dr Jitendra Singh, I saw those majestic peaks, which were freed from the clutches of Pakistan by our valiant soldiers by laying down their lives yet not before incurring a crushing defeat to the enemy and failing its evil designs. I\u2019ve just witnessed the testimonies to their (gallant soldiers\u2019) valour and heroic deeds which earned India a proud victory.\u201dRajnath stated that the Ujh bridge, which as per Director General-Border Road Organisation\u2019s assertion, was the longest bridge constructed by the organization anywhere in the country, would ease problems of border residents related to connectivity. \u201cIn the form of bridge, the long pending demand of border residents has been realized. The strenuous efforts of Border Road Organisation (BRO) to complete this bridge in stipulated period despite lot of problems and hostile conditions are, undoubtedly, laudable,\u201d the Defence Minister said."

In a series of motivational lectures, Thakur told students on Thursday that the decision to come to Bhadarwah to take part in the \"Sangam Youth Festival\" organised by the army changed her life forever as she decided to join the armed forces. Hailing from Billan Bowlian in Udhampur district, Thakur joined the IAF as a fighter pilot this year, one of the first few women in the country to have done so. Her motivational lectures, organised by the Rashtriya Rifles unit based at Bhadarwah, are inspiring youngsters, especially girls, in the state to make a mark in life. \u201cI decided that I had to go for it, whatever it took. I would want every young boy and girl wanting to become a fighter pilot to dream big,\u201d Thakur told. In her message to the students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and PG College Bhadarwah, she said, \u201cYour dreams may seem unconquerable at the moment. But you must chase those so hard that they become reality.\u201d Stating that a \"combination of average qualities\" in her made her unique, Thakur said, \u201cI climbed the ladder step by step, committing some mistakes as well, but kept going as I learned it the hard way. Instead of mourning over your failures and get into self pity, you should work harder to achieve your goals.\u201d She said being an NCC cadet helped her keep her nerves in the most difficult situations. The lectures were followed by question-answer sessions with the students. Aarushi, a Class 12 science student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, said she always thought becoming a doctor was the only option for her but Thakur''s words changed that. \u201cI already feel like flying as joining the army is my childhood dream. I will definitely strive harder to make my dream a reality,\u201d she said. Komal Katal (27) of Garh Bhadarwah village said, \u201cI always wanted to join the Army but in this part of the state, I never got an opportunity to try my luck. Although I could not appear in AFCAT (Air Force Common Admission Test) because of the age bar, after attending the lecture of Jubiksha, I will work harder and give it a try to join the Territorial Army.\u201d Besides Thakur, Commanding Officer, 4 Rashtriya Rifles Colonel D D Pandey also shared his experiences with the students. \u201cYou should be passionate about your dreams and to reach your destination, you should not hesitate and think longer to take your first step. Just start your journey today and you will definitely reach your destination,\u201d he said."

            "He went on to say that in Britain no media would have published the kind of remarks that the Pakistani media had since he had come into power.",
            "\"A prime minister of a country and this man sits on television and says he is 'getting divorced tomorrow',\" remarked PM Imran, referring to rumours that had circulated in the media a few months ago about the premier\u2019s allegedly rocky relationship with First Lady Bushra Bibi.",
            "\"In the olden days, this guy would have been beaten up. In Nawaz Sharif's time, he had journalists beaten up. Asif Zardari \u2014 people were petrified of him. People would disappear,\" he said.",
            "The premier said he, on the other hand, had gone through the legal channels to take action. ",
            "\"So what we need, is to control the media, not through the government but through a media watchdog.",
            "\"They reported wrongly that the IMF had said that the rupee would fall, to a number they quoted. There was a run on the rupee. Who would do that [anywhere else in the world]?\"",
            "He said that the government was on the one hand struggling to revive the economy and on the other hand the media was falsely reporting such things and causing a run on the rupee.",
            "\"I feel very strongly we will strengthen the media watchdog. It is not censorship. There are 70-80 channels in Pakistan. Only three reported they were having some problems.\"",
            "He said that the media would have to be more accountable and will have to answer for their source of income. ",
            "\"Even if we ask them about taxes, they say \u2018this is against freedom of expression\u2019.\"",
            "When asked what role Pakistan can play in calming the rising tensions with Iran without ruining the relations it has with other countries, the prime minister said that an offer had already been made to Iran for Pakistan to play a role and until recently, Iran was receptive to the idea, but now seemed \"desperate\".",
            "He urged all the countries to avoid pushing Iran into a conflict.",
            "\"I'm not sure all the countries realise the gravity of the situation if there is a conflict with Iran [...] This is not going to be the same as Iraq. This could be much, much, worse. It will have grave, adverse consequences for our country [as well]. ",
            "\"It could unleash terrorism where Al Qaeda would be forgotten,\" warned PM Imran."
